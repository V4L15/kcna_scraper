            "content": "Japan Not Qualified to Participate in Six-party Talks: KCNA \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- Japan has persistently misbehaved in the international arena only to see its poor image sagging. At international meetings now, Japan is behaving rashly, hammering repeatedly away at its chosen theme of \"abduction issue\", ignorant of their main theme and purport. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It insisted that \"sanctions should not be eased\", \"north Korea can not sidestep the 'abduction issue' within the framework of the six-party talks\" and \"Japan is concerned over the U.S. 'perfidy'.\" This misbehavior on the part of Japan has left a disgusting and unpleasant impression on the international community and media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan took such approaches at the previous talks, adversely affecting the progress of the talks and becoming a target of accusing fingers. Still today it refuses to abandon this misbehavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is stooping to any infamy in hindering and barring the settlement of a problem in the international political arena to gratify its ambition of ultra-nationalism. This extremely shrewd selfishness is a natural result of the nature of the state of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For Abe to make any concession over the \"abduction issue\" means his political death, considering that he succeeded in assuming the premiership by lifting his approval rating through his hard-line policy toward the DPRK in reliance upon the political foothold of the ultra-right conservative forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now he finds himself in an embarrassing situation as he is compelled to go against the general trend of the international community in order to pay what he owes to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has entered the new century without settling its crime-woven past in which it brought misfortunes and pains to a countless number of people in the Asia-Pacific region. Now it is vociferating about a \"threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to cover up its moral vulgarity and create an atmosphere favorable for reviving militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula at the six-party talks would leave Japan stripped of one of its major pretexts for realizing its militarist ambition to become the leader of Asia. For this reason Japan is resorting to every conceivable means to scuttle the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The misbehavior of Japan to drive the six-party talks to a collapse by throwing an artificial snag in the way of their progress is inviting criticism and derision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that Japan made it its state view that \"there should be no aid to north Korea unless the abduction issue is solved.\" In order to get rid of the situation where it stands isolated in the trend of the times, Japan is playing sleight of hand, crying that \"if the U.S. pays no heed to the shared understanding, it will inflict a deep wound on the matchless bilateral relations\" and \"Japan-U.S. alliance will face a crisis if there is any difference in the recognition of threat.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is illogical for a country which does not wish to see any success of the talks to involve itself in the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is not qualified to attend a political dialogue for peace and stability as it is swimming against the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Joint Military Maneuvers Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The U.S. bellicose forces in collusion with the south Korean warmongers on Mar. 25 started the RSOI and Foal Eagle joint military exercises, going against the trend of the times. These joint drills involve massive war forces including the U.S. forces from the mainland and the Pacific region and its troops in south Korea and south Korean troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has hurled into these war games Stealth fighter-bombers which earned ill-fame in armed invasions and wars of aggression against other countries in the past, and the task force of an ultra-modern super large nuclear-powered carrier. This is a highly dangerous act of a nuclear war to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK at any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military hysterics of the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces is bringing a touch-and-go crisis of war to the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an open secret that the U.S. has rounded off detailed war scenarios against the DPRK such as \"OPLAN-5027\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The carrot-and-stick policy is the trite stratagem of aggression of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time when each side should be more prudent than any other time in all its behavior and, especially, be most circumspect in military actions, and make special efforts to boost the atmosphere of dialogue and promote mutual trust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The massive war games launched by the U.S. bellicose forces against the DPRK cannot be construed otherwise than a criminal artifice to spoil the atmosphere of dialogue, check the progress of the six-party talks and the implementation of the agreed articles, push the DPRK out of the conference room by getting on its nerves and find a pretext for a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable stand and principle of the DPRK to answer good faith with good faith and strength and with strength.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It should be forced to pay for its crimes under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has long pursued confrontation with the DPRK and national division, lording it over the south Korean people with the backing of the outsiders, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the predecessors of the GNP from the Liberal Party of traitor Syngman Rhee to the Democratic Republican Party of the \"Yusin\" dictator, the Democratic Justice Party, the Democratic Liberal Party and the New Korea Party of the dictators of the \"fifth and sixth republics\" and the \"civilian\"-veiled dictator earned an ill-fame for their sycophantic acts of treachery, confrontation with fellow countrymen and fascist repression. But the GNP, successor to these fascist political parties, is still making desperate efforts to repeat such crime-woven past. This is a challenge to the era and history and an unpardonable mockery of the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the GNP has perpetrated so far is an inevitable product of the treacherous policy of depending on foreign forces and anti-reunification policy followed by all its predecessors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They ignited a war of aggression against the fellow countrymen in league with the foreign forces, indifferent to the destiny of the country and the nation, and built a high wall dividing Korea, pursuant to the foreign forces' policy of \"two Koreas.\" The GNP with such crime-woven past has persistently blocked the advance of the June 15 era of reunification, desperately throwing obstacles in the way of the cause of independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever their power base shook, the predecessors of the GNP maintained their power at the point of bayonet, changing their signboards. The history of the GNP is, therefore, stained with the blood shed by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural that the people from all walks of life in south Korea are strongly demanding a thorough probe into the truth about the human rights abuses committed by the GNP in the past and the reexamination of the faked-up cases, punishment of the assailants, apology and compensation to the victims and their reinstatement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
