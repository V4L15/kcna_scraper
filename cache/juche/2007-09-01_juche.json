Koreans Urged to Struggle for Sovereignty and Dignity\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 31 (KCNA) -- Independence against the U.S. guarantees the sovereignty and dignity of the south Korean people and their genuine life and happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a nation is trampled down by outsiders, deprived of its sovereignty, it will lose the worth of its existence and suffer humiliation and maltreatment, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of occupation of south Korea is a policy for domination and subjugation.\r\n The U.S. has wantonly violated the south Korean people's dignity and right to existence, after depriving them of their sovereignty through its policy of occupation for the last more than six decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When making a scrutiny into lots of \"treaties\" and \"agreements\" signed between south Korea and the U.S. one can hardly find any provision or point calling for respecting the sovereignty of south Korea and guaranteeing the rights and interests of its people. All of them are aimed to meet the unilateral demands and interests of the U.S. only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. legalized and perpetuated its forces' presence in south Korea through the south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defence treaty\" and granted the aggression forces with extraterritorial rights through the south Korea-U.S. \"SOFA,\" the document encroaching upon the dignity and interests of the south Korean people and seriously threatening their vital rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the very day of their occupation of south Korea the U.S. forces have taken the lives of a countless number of south Koreans, regarding them as animals and playthings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior aim sought by the U.S. in staging together with the south Korean military forces the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises under the simulated conditions of war against the north is to realize its wild ambition to dominate the whole of Korea even at the cost of lives of tens of millions of south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the south Koreans will neither enjoy dignity and sovereignty nor escape the danger to their lives and properties as long as the U.S. imperialist aggression forces are allowed to stay in their land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
