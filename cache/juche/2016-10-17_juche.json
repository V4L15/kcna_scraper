            "content": "Working People's Organizations Warn Park Geun Hye of Severest Punishment\r\n Pyongyang, October 17 (KCNA) -- The Joint National Association of Working People's Organizations made public a statement on Monday. They comprise the Central Committees of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League, the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, the Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea and the Democratic Women's Union of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye of south Korea is taking the lead in escalating confrontation with the DPRK, telling all sorts of lies about it, not content with the smear campaign to stir up confrontation with the fellow countrymen, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, the traitor appeared at the \"ceremony of commemorating the ROK army day\", \"the state council meeting\" and various other events almost every day at which she let out a flurry of malignant invectives to create impression that something happened inside the DPRK with such rhetoric as \"tyrannical policy\" and \"crack in social system.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor went the lengths of predicting a lot of northerners will \"defect\" to south Korea not just in quest of means of living but under the name of immigration and expecting even those of elite circle to make their ways to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She did not hesitate to spout such rubbish that south Korea would \"greet them by keeping the door open so that they may pursue their dreams and happiness\", describing it as a \"cradle of freedom.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she uttered is a crime against humanity as it is intended to hurt the life of the people in the DPRK and divide the great family under socialism and a last-ditch effort of a psychopath to \"bring down\" its social system and realize her foolish daydream of \"unification through absorption.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bitterly denouncing this in the name of all Koreans, the statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her undisguised agitation of \"defection\" is little short of admitting herself that it is none other than Park herself who is chiefly to blame for the past hideous allurement and abduction operations against DPRK citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is no more than her hysteric fit to conceal the worst human rights situation in south Korea caused by her fascist crackdown and misrule and the eye-opening reality in which the DPRK has made a long drive despite her desperate moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is busy agitating \"defection\" by pinning slight hope on the theory of \"preemptive attack\" spread by the U.S. as she is clinging to the coattails of her American master after being frightened by the DPRK's nuclear capability for self-defense. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As she revealed her ambition to achieve \"unification through absorption\", going beyond the tolerance limit, the working people of the DPRK solemnly declare an all-out sacred war to topple the corrupt, reactionary ruling system in south Korea and cut off the lifeline of the traitor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers, peasants, youth and students and women in the DPRK will deal the most deadly hammer blows at Park Geun Hye and force her to pay the dearest price for the crimes she perpetrated against the Korean people."
