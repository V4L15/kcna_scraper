Her words suggest that she is by no means intelligent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has taken necessary measures to protect the nation's sovereignty and right to existence to cope with the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat, not to attract anyone's attention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., however, is taking the lead in making much ado about nothing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was the U.S. that helped the DPRK to become the world focus. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe cannot but regard Mrs. Clinton as a funny lady as she likes to utter such rhetoric, unaware of the elementary etiquette in the international community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnyone making misstatements has to pay for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our view that she can make even a little contribution to the implementation of the U.S. administration's foreign policy as secretary of State only when she has understanding of the world, to begin with."

It had long been regarded as an inexorable law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the social and class relations and the balance of forces change according to the progress of the times and the development of the reality, the question of the main force in the revolution cannot remain invariable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) has put up the people's army as the main force of revolution on a scientific analysis of its characteristics and role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe revolutionary army is made up with fine core members, the vanguard fighters, among the laboring classes and strata such as workers, peasants and intellectuals and stands at the outpost of the serious and acute armed struggle.
