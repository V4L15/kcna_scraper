This was possible entirely thanks to the great army-first leadership and independent politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche idea which reflects the need of the era of independence is an idea centered on the popular masses as it clarifies principles and methods for transforming society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between Japan and the DPRK, he said that although Japan-DPRK inter-governmental talks were resumed, the reactionary forces have raised the issue of \"suspected kidnapping,\" a fiction, opposing the inter-governmental negotiations for opening Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations. If Japan truly wishes the normalization of relations, it should, first of all, sincerely repent of its unprecedented aggression and plunder against the Korean people and apologize and compensate to them for those crimes, he urged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Vice-president Yasushi Akashi of the People's Council for Promoting the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and the DPRK who is former UN deputy secretary general said in a lecture on the Korean issue that Japan should honestly apologize and compensate for its past crimes as Germany did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is good for the improvement of Japan-DPRK relations, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Japanese should conduct a vigorous campaign for independence, peace and the promotion of the opening of diplomatic relations between Japan and the DPRK in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers called for cherishing the unshakable faith in the Juche idea and conducting energetic activities for the study and dissemination of the Juche idea to promote the opening of diplomatic relations between Japan and the DPRK and achieve Japan's independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a clear example of his unshakable patriotic will for reunification to save the reunification movement from crisis and further expand and develop it at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A steady continuity has been given to the movement of national reunification, which was in danger of a setback, and the driving force for accomplishing the cause of national independence has grown stronger. This is a great feat he has performed in the nation's cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His provision of the historic north-south joint declaration, a landmark of national reunification in the 21st century, was his greatest feat performed in the  struggle to accomplish the cause of reunification at the turn of the century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He indicated a bright road of independent reunification with his invincible idea on national reunification and strategy and tactics. his ideas and policies for national reunification are strategy and tactics centering on the nation as they reflect the nation's requirements and interests and give an impetus to the reunification movement based on the internal force of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His leadership over the movement for national reunification is invincible leadership as it ensures victory by strengthening the driving force of reunification, resolutely rejecting outside forces and providing conditions for the development of the reunification movement on the nation's own initiative.    \r\n\r\n"
