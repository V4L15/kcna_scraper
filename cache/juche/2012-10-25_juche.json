            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Denounces U.S. Special Representative's Anti-DPRK Remarks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, October 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Thursday as regards anti-DPRK invectives made by U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Glyn Davis:\n\t\t\t\t\t A few days ago he, touring areas around the DPRK, said that it would be a big blunder for the DPRK if it scraps the September 19 joint statement and it should opt for implementing its obligation. He also called for suspending missile and nuclear weapons development and said he hoped there would not be any provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is illogical for the U.S. to urge the DPRK to honor its obligation while it is not complying with what it committed to do in the September 19 joint statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement specifies the U.S. political, military and economic commitments to fundamentally end its hostile policy toward the DPRK as a chief culprit of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., quite contrary to its commitments in the joint statement, wantonly violated the sovereignty of the DPRK and openly and systematically stepped up military threats and economic sanctions against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. increased hostile policy toward the DPRK compelled it to bolster its nuclear deterrent both in quality and quantity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. oft-repeated \"provocation\" reveals its fear as a criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, provocation has been committed by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces which have resorted to military threats to the DPRK and the moves of scattering anti-DPRK leaflets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent and principled stand of the army and people of the DPRK to counter provocation with prompt counterattack and aggression war with just and great war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. negotiator does not have clear understanding of the essence and the circumstances of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and is not aware of where threats to peace and stability come from. This makes the prospect of solving the issue gloomier."
