            "content": "DPRK delegate speaks at third committee of 56th UN General Assembly \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 23 (KCNA) -- A DPRK delegate made a speech at the meeting of the third committee of the 56th United Nations General Assembly on Nov. 15 when the \"human rights issue\" was under discussion. He recalled that the world is witnessing more blatant human right abuses of various forms in the international arena such as political, economic and military intervention, unilateral high-handed practices, acts of splitting the nations, assaults on minorities and women and national chauvinism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If such high-handed practices as a strong country suppresses a weak country are allowed to go on, it will only spark resistance and confrontation in the international arena, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If genuine human rights are to be protected and promoted, it is necessary to establish equal relations between states and realize international cooperation on the basis of impartiality and mutual respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing the U.S. delegation of pulling up the DPRK over the \"human rights issue,\" he dismissed it as a product of the premeditated plot to impair its authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better examine its worst human rights situation and open it to the world before talking about \"human rights issue\" in other countries, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All member countries of the U.N. should promote international cooperation in the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation on the principle of equal sovereign right and respect for free choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such \"humanitarian\" interference as infringing upon the sovereignty of an independent state under the signboard of \"protecting human rights\" should not be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is urgent to give priority to the right to existence and development, an inseparable factor of protecting and promoting human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the policies of the DPRK government are based on the Juche idea which regards man as most valuable and makes everything serve him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will continue to strengthen the people-centered system chosen and liked by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will respect the international conventions on human rights and pursue the relevant dialogue and cooperation on this principle and in that direction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will in the future, too, positively contribute to the international cooperation in order to guarantee the people genuine rights.    \r\n\r\n"

This is 10 percent of its annual military spending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was by no means fortuitous that the u.s. secretary of defense praised such \"contribution\" of Japan as \"a model to be followed by the U.S. allies.\" The prolonged presence of the U.S. forces in Japan is increasing Japan's military dependence upon the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan is considering the U.S. as heaven and providing all necessary conditions for its forces' stay there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to eloquently prove that U.S. assertion that its forces' presence in Japan is for its \"security\" is nothing but a sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country in Asia threatens to invade or attack Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such a thing did not happen in the past nor is likely to happen at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the contrary, other Asian countries are exposed to the threat of Japan's military aggression and attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having wound up its war preparations, Japan has legally paved the way for overseas aggression. It is now ready to mount an attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's armed forces trained as running dogs of the U.S. are about to pounce upon the Asian people, grinding their poisonous teeth with vexation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has emerged a real aggression force, war force threatening peace in Asia.    \r\n\r\n"
