            "content": "Pro-Japanese flunkeyist acts of S. Korean authorities\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities committed despicable pro-Japanese flunkeyist and traitorous acts during the South Korea visit of the Japanese Prime Minister which took place between March 19 and 21, a few days before the 35th anniversary of the March 24 Uprising of South Korean people against the treacherous \"South Korea-Japan talks\" and \"South Korea-Japan treaty.\"   In this connection, South Korean people vehemently denounce the present South Korean rulers as detestable watch dogs of the United States and Japan and villainous flunkeyists and traitors who put the preceding rulers in the shade, and the entire nation is burning with indignation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As well known to the world, Japan has neither apologized for nor reflected on the indelible unethical crimes committed against the Korean people in the past but has committed all sorts of wrongdoings, preoccupied with the wild ambition for reinvasion.   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities welcomed the Japanese Prime Minister with  \"Hinomaru\" flay displayed in different places of South Korea, the flag which is symbolic of imperialist Japan and which is stained with blood shed by Korean and other Asian peoples. And they openly chimed in with what the Japanese reactionaries have argued, prompted by an ill-gotten desire to impair the dignity of the Korean nation and attain their old dream of colonial domination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In an attempt to curry favour with the Japanese master, the South Korean chief executive contended that the north must resolve the \"missile issue\" and repatriate \"those abducted by it.\" To make matters worse, he unhesitatingly made provocative remarks that a \"strong warning message\" must be sent to the north on the basis of maintaining a \"resolute security posture.\"   We cannot but take a serious view of his provocative remarks because they prove that the South Korean chief executive is actively involved in the anti-DPRK campaign launched by the Japanese reactionaries to impinge on the national dignity and sovereignty of the Korean people, after branding the DPRK's  launch of its first satellite as a \"ballistic missile launch.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Feeling very grateful for a few pennies of \"loans\" from Japan, the South Korean authorities whitewashed its past history of aggression and agreed to fling the door open for the corrupt mass culture of Japan, a crime which no other preceding dictatorial \"government\" dared not do. On top of it, they left all economic interests-related fields of South Korea including fishing grounds to the avaricious Japanese monopoly capital lock, stock and barrel under the name of \"substantial cooperation.\"   This glaringly reveals their true colors as pro-Japanese flunkeyists and traitors who sold off the national dignity to Japan for a few dollars, the noose of subjugation.   The South Korean authorities will not escape bitterer denunciation by the nation. \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "S. Korea's unreasonable argument about \"exchange\"\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the South Korean chief executive said that South Korea would \"exchange\" unconverted long-term prisoners with \"ROK army prisoners of war\" and \"those abducted by the north.\"   This is a groundless and unjustifiable sophism to mislead public opinion and part of the renewed smear campaign to refuse the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners to the north.   The unconverted long-term prisoners do not hail from South Korea. That was why ever since the very day when they were taken prisoner, they have consistently demanded that they be repatriated to the northern half of the country. Now, they have become disabled owing to prison terms spanning scores of years. Moreover, they have no family members in South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are in the North Korea no such men as \"ROK army POWs\" and \"those abducted by the north\" on the lips of the South Korean authorities. If any, they are people who joined the People's Army of their own accord after refusing to serve any more the U.S. as their cannon fodder during the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-July 1953) and who voluntarily came over to the north in search of a genuine life.    Since their marriage in the north, they, together with their family members, have lived happily as citizens of the DPRK and expressed their will not to return to South Korea, a veritable hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, the South Korean authorities proposed to \"exchange\" them with the unconverted long-term prisoners who want to come back to the north where their family members are awaiting them.   Their allegation is very unjustifiable both from the humanitarian point of view and in light of International Law.   Their move is contrary to their loud-mouthed \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy.\"   The South Korean authorities should apologize for having put unconverted long-term prisoners to unheard-of torture and maltreatment, keeping them behind bars for scores of years, and return them to the north as soon as possible. \r\n\r\n"

The bulletin said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" of South Korea in a recent \"lecture given at an invitation\" said that \"reunification must be based on the view on the value of liberal democracy.\"   His utterances fully reveal the ulterior intention of the South Korean authorities to expand the anti-social and  reactionary social system of South Korea even to the North Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent rigmarole of the \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" fully represents the stand of the present South Korean \"government,\" not his personal view.   This shows the South Korean rulers have no iota of will for reunification and that they seek only to hurt the fellow countrymen in the north with the help of outsiders.

It is a preliminary drill to be seen on the eve of a war against the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Moreover, the drill is under way just before the South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise \"RSOI\", which clearly illustrates that the United States is going to ignite a war against the north on all accounts.

The truth is proved by the realities in some countries.   A nation should stand up to the desperate moves of the imperialists to stifle it. Only then can it defend its dignity and sovereignty.   Victory is in store for a country and a nation defying imperialism.   Clear evidence of the truth is the history of anti-imperialist struggle of the Korean people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the U.S. hard-line conservatives invented on purpose a suspicion of \"underground nuclear facility\" in the DPRK and raised a brigandish demand for inspection. They have been up to their ears in putting into practice the \"5027 operation plan\" for a second Korean war of aggression, talking about \"surgical operation-style\" strike, \"tough counteraction\" and \"nuclear punishment.\" The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK solemnly declared that they would deal an annihilating blow to them. The DPRK has an army and a people with unshakable faith that they are sure to win in a war with the U.S. It has powerful self-reliant national defense capabilities as well. So, it protects the nation's supreme interests and security, defends Korean anthropocentric socialism with credit and exalts the dignity and honor of Juche Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even the slightest concession should not be tolerated in the struggle to adhere to the anti-imperialist principle and defend the dignity and honor of the nation.

He also expressed official support for Japan raising such issues as \"missile\" and \"those kidnapped by the north\" and begged for its understanding of the \"engagement approach toward the north.\" and he went the length of calling for \"message of warning\" to the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This fully revealed once again the dirty colors of the South Korean ruling groups as traitors seeking to do harm to the fellow countrymen in collaboration with the Japanese reactionaries.   The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean ruling quarters are now advertising that they will build \"future-oriented relations,\" \"new partnership for the 21st century,\" and achieve \"co-prosperity\" through \"mutual cooperation.\"   After all, the \"new bilateral relations\" on their lips show that a \"new chapter\" has been opened for the revival of Japanese militarism, realization of its design for comeback to Korea, Japan's political and economic domination over South Korea and their military tie-ups.   \"co-prosperity\" through \"mutual cooperation\" means only domination and subjugation.

            "content": "Folly\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- A letter of the \"speaker of the National Assembly\" of South Korea came to the President of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) of the DPRK from the South Korean Red Cross on March 17.   On the envelope the address and name of a man who was supposed to receive the letter were not properly written.   The letter should have been sent to the chairman of the SPA.   The contention of the South Korean \"National Assembly speaker\" that he may send a letter to any one is clear evidence of  the ignorance of his lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It must not go unnoticed that in the letter the \"speaker\" mentioned an \"early holding of inter-Korean dialogue for implementation of the basic agreement,\" \"discussions of outstanding issues between the two sides of Korea, including the implementation of the basic agreement\" and \"parliamentary-level exchange of opinions and interaction.\"   The \"speaker\" does not know to whom he has to speak regarding those matters.   From what is said in the letter, no doubt, the letter should have been addressed to the South Korean authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some time ago, the government, political parties and organizations of the DPRK put forward a most reasonable and most realistic proposal for authority-to-authority talks oriented towards the reunification of the country, at a joint meeting, and, in this regard, sent letters to 150 personages of South Korea.   Inter-Korean dialogue has not yet been arranged. The South Korean authorities are to blame for it. They still refuse to stop \"cooperation\" and joint military maneuvers with outsiders, abolish the \"National Security Law\" and provide pro-reunification patriotic organisations and figures with the freedom of pro-reunification patriotic movement and activities. All that should be done before inter-Korean dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the \"speaker\" really wants to see pro-reunification dialogue, he should not have sent the letter to the north side, but urged the South Korean authorities to do as early as possible all that should be done before the dialogue.   If the South Korean \"National Assembly\" wants to remain a waiting maid of the authorities, the \"exchange of opinions and interaction\" with the \"National Assembly\" will bring nothing good.   The South Korean \"National Assembly speaker\" should not be up to his ears in mailing, bereft of etiquette and common knowledge, but mind his own business to make sure that priorities to realize inter-Korean dialogue are implemented. \r\n\r\n"

It is to offer also seed potatoes, fertilizers, agricultural  chemicals and others for potato production.     Such a step is taken by the U.S. administration apart from the offer of 300,000 tons of food now under way. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Sin Sang Jae defects to north\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- A South Korean Sin Sang Jae, 43, and his children have defected to the North Korea.   He hailed from Ulsan, South Kyongsang Province.   He has made video-recorded teaching materials ever since graduation from the national fisheries university of Pusan in 1986. He worked as a representative of a Visual Education Development Agency in Ulju county before his defection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As to the motive of his defection, he said he has been disillusioned with the society of South Korea and that he has been interested in the north where the dignity of the nation is exalted under the guidance of General Secretary Kim Jong Il who is pursuing the anthropocentric policy of independence and all the people lead a happy life full of hopes.   He has been convinced that the north is a genuine society where the soul of the nation is kept alive and children can be grown to be men, sound mentally and physically, he said.   When he and his children were on overseas trip for tourism, he defected to the north, he added. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
