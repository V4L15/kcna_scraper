            "content": "Japan's Charade Aimed at Military Supremacy under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 25 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government recently clarified that it would adopt a policy to regard countering \"ballistic missile attack\" from someone as a major goal of its \"plan to protect the people\".\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Monday observes that Japan's talk about \"missile threat\" allegedly from the DPRK is a provocation to it and the \"plan to protect the people\" is nothing but a fig-leaf to cover up its sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable ambition of the Japanese reactionaries to hold military supremacy over Northeast Asia and unfailingly realize at a proper time the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,\" which Japan failed to do so in the past. They attempt to contain not only the DPRK but China and Russia under the signboard of fictitious \"missile attack\" in a bid to ensure military supremacy. That is why they are pushing forward their moves to convert Japan into a military giant in real earnest and working hard together with the U.S. to develop and deploy the missile defense system.\r\n The danger of Japan's military expansion and militarism is now further increasing than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's ambition to establish military supremacy over Northeast Asia is an anachronistic one as it leads to its second defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to face up to the times and reality with a cool head and give up its megalomaniacal dream.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Missile Defense System will result in expanding military confrontation and arms race to the space and obstructing the peaceful development and use of the space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK delegation denounces all the acts to militarize the space and hold that an international legal system and a preventive mechanism to check the militarization of the space should be established amid the concern of all the UN member nations and by their efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, all the countries should be allowed to freely participate in the peaceful development and use of the space on an equal footing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attempts to obstruct the space development of developing countries for the maintenance of technological priority and to monopolize it should be strictly rejected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The activities of developing countries to develop the space should be encouraged as the space is a common property of all countries and nations, though there may be technological differences between advanced and backward countries in the development of the space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it is important to make the achievements registered in space development a common property for the wellbeing of all countries and peoples. To this end, all the space plans worked out by the UN should give priority to helping the developing countries and the developed countries should sincerely share the space technology and achievements with the developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will further develop space science and technology and actively promote cooperation and exchange with the United Nations and various countries of the world in the peaceful use of the space.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It gave rise to the nuclear issue, the focal point of the DPRK-U.S. confrontation, by its persistent moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and is shameless enough to brand the DPRK as \"a nuclear criminal.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, in recent years, the U.S. has massively shipped ultra-modern military hardware into south Korea and staged war games under various names, presenting military threat and blackmail to the DPRK, while misleading world opinion and whipping up hostile feelings toward the DPRK by pulling it up over the fictitious \"human rights problem.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts show that the Korean issue cannot be settled without a change in the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and that peace cannot be preserved on the Korean Peninsula, not to speak of its reunification, without a tough countermeasure to cope with the U.S. \"doctrine of strength.\" \r\n It is only too legitimate right of the Korean people to build up their self-defensive and peaceable force to counterbalance the U.S. harebrained racket for nuclear confrontation and military pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Respected Your Excellency Kim Jong Il are overwhelming the reckless strong-arm and arbitrary practices and new war provocation moves of the U.S. and firmly defending the sovereignty and vital rights of the Korean people with your outstanding Songun policy. This is not only great exploits in defending peace on the Korean Peninsula but also a significant contribution to the peace of the world and the cause of independence of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will expose and condemn the injustice of the U.S. dominationism and moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and arouse support and encouragement of broad global community to the just struggle of the Korean people and thus always remain on the side of your people in the righteous struggle to ensure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and reunify divided Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Urged to Withdraw Troops from Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 25 (KCNA) -- South Korea is seized with uneasiness and horror after international terrorist organization Al Qaeda declared that it would mount an indiscriminate attack on south Korea for having dispatched combat troops to Iraq.\r\n Blaming the U.S., a terrorist kingpin, for the threat of terrorist attack posed to south Korea, a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Monday observes that had the U.S. not launched the war of aggression against Iraq, a sovereign state, and pressurized the south Korean authorities to dispatch troops to Iraq, south Korea would not have been listed as a target of terrorist attack and exposed to the present threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that young and middle-aged south Koreans were hurled into Iraq as bullet shields under the pressure of the U.S. and south Korea is accused of being fighting a proxy war and collaborating with the U.S. in its war of aggression, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities can never evade the responsibility for the present disturbing development as they sent troops to Iraq, yielding to the U.S. brigandish demand despite people's strong opposition to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The only way for south Korea to get rid of terror-phobia is not to increase security alert or to take a measure to prohibit entry of suspects into it but to withdraw its troops from Iraq without delay and stop supporting the U.S. in the implementation of its policy for a war of aggression. This would be beneficial to south Korea as this is urgently required by the times and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clearly face up to the reality today when the people's life and security are seriously threatened, stop reading the face of outsiders and take a bold decision to pull back their troops from Iraq.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The coffin chamber is between the fourth and fifth stories. \r\nThe tomb is 34 meters long and 14.3 meters high, which resembles a big structure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mounded tomb with a stone chamber is a developed form of piled stone tomb.

Nearly a hundred tombs of this shape have been discovered.

            "content": "KCNA Assails Projected Joint Naval Exercise\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 25 (KCNA) -- The United States plans to stage a joint naval exercise in waters off Japan from Oct. 26, pursuant to the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) by letting the Japanese reactionaries come to the fore.\r\n Through this the U.S. seeks to plug countries around Japan into the exercise in a bid to step up its operation to isolate and stifle the DPRK and consolidate \"international cooperation\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given the objective of the PSI to isolate and blockade the DPRK, it is quite clear that the exercise is designed to lay a siege to the DPRK and stifle it come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After working out the PSI whose major aim is to intercept ships and airplanes, the U.S. has staged 10 joint naval exercises under simulated conditions of an actual operation by mobilizing troops of its allies. It has put the exercises on a regular basis under the pretext of \"combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has pursued the strategy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, asserting that the international community is entitled to intercept ships and planes suspected of spreading weapons in the open seas and along international air routes after advancing a weapons proliferation prevention security initiative and a principle to intercept WMD last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and an intolerable military provocation to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. is pushing the strategy of international blockade to the phase of its implementation. A very dangerous situation is prevailing on the Korean Peninsula at present due to its reckless military moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected exercise assumes a very serious nature as it is slated to take place against the backdrop of growing tensions on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. massive redeployment of forces and madcap arms buildup are going on the Korean Peninsula and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region as evidenced by the deployment of Aegis destroyers of the U.S. 7th fleet equipped with up-to-date missile system in the East Sea of Korea which have already begun performing their operational duties for an actual war. The projected exercise can not be viewed as something not related to these moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has warned more than once that naval blockade exercises targeted against it would not be favorable for the atmosphere of dialogue. The U.S. ceaseless military maneuvers of this form go to clearly prove that it does not stand for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected exercise only betrays the U.S. stand of denying dialogue and harassing peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is so shameless as to completely deny its dialogue partner and put pressure upon it while openly pressing for the PSI exercises to blockade and stifle the DPRK behind the scene of dialogue and threatening to bring up the nuclear issue for discussion at the UN Security Council. These moves only make the prospect of the negotiations with it dimmer as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue can never go together with war exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to escalate tension on the Korean Peninsula instead of working for peace in Northeast Asia including the peninsula. The planned exercise indicates that the U.S. strategy to militarily blockade and stifle the DPRK is inching close to the phase of its full implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but call into question Japan, the host of the joint naval exercises, and other participants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, in fact, illegal and serious infringement upon the sovereignty of other countries defying international law and norms of mutual relations between countries to participate in such exercises aimed to intercept vessels of sovereign countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the Japanese authorities to host the exercises targeted against the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. policy to isolate and blockade the DPRK, diametrically runs counter to the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish an act for some countries to support and participate in the exercises which are little short of an open infringement upon the sovereignty of independent countries, pursuant to the U.S. unilateral and self-justified strategy for hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is compelled to serve a serious warning to the U.S., regarding the exercise as a move to implement the U.S. preemptive interception strategy aimed to isolate and stifle the DPRK internationally and an ultimate war action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. has become more undisguised in its hostile policy toward the DPRK despite its repeated warnings, the latter is left with no option but to increase its physical deterrent force in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. seeks to wrest a sort of concession from the DPRK through military threat and blackmail, this will only betray its total ignorance of its rival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop running wild, clearly understanding the will of the army and people of the DPRK to return fire for fire and react to the hard-line policy with the toughest stand.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
