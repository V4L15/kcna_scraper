The U.S. economic potential is too weak to support its reckless policy of strength. This is why the U.S. is trying to use its allies, satellites and puppets for intensifying aggression by proxy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to prevent war and protect world peace, it is imperative to check and frustrate the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war and, to this end, smash their strategy for aggression by proxy as well as their policy of strength.    \r\n\r\n"

In the wake of the incident it was confirmed by the security authorities and media that this was misinformation which had been provided by an unidentified jobless loafer. But the Japanese authorities are putting spurs to beefing up maritime \"self-defense force\", persistently floating the fiction of \"threat from North Korea\", instead of making an apology for this diatribe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such move is a grave encroachment upon the DPRK's sovereignty and dignity and a reckless provocation made by those hell-bent on the anti-DPRK smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries seem to have become extremely arrogant after openly setting out on the road of overseas expansion by taking advantage of the \"September 11 incident\". They do not bother to encroach upon the sovereignty of independent states even in violation of the generally accepted international laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Japanese maritime forces are doing in coastal waters from the Asia-Pacific region to the Indian ocean is reminiscent of the piracy committed by the Japanese imperialists' fleet of aggression in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a very serious development as it clearly indicates to the international community once again that the Japanese reactionaries are only keen to realize their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\", far from repenting of the war of aggression committed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will never allow Japan, to start a war of overseas aggression once again with the Korean peninsula as a springboard as it committed indelible crimes against the Korean people in the past.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on unreasonable assertion \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- Recently some media, predicting the DPRK-U.S. relations this year, conveyed what  They called views of U.S. experts on the Korean peninsula that the inspection of the nuclear facilities of the DPRK should be made from the middle of the year according to the plan to push forward the building of the light water reactors.\r\n This is an unreasonable assertion that reflects the viewpoints of impure elements keen to distort the basic spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and the principles that should be maintained in putting it into practice and shift the responsibility for the delayed construction of lwrs on to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic spirit of the framework is that the U.S. is obliged to provide the DPRK with the light water reactors in return for the DPRK's freezing of nuclear facilities and the two sides agreed to abide by the principle of simultaneous honest implementation of their obligations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of the publication of the framework the DPRK has fully implemented its obligation, suffering a huge loss caused by the freeze of the independent nuclear power industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side, however, pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK, has implemented none of its obligations properly laid down in the framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The insincere attitude and stand of the U.S. side has seriously delayed the construction of the lwrs which it had promised to provide to the DPRK by the year 2003. It is told that the project is likely to be completed by the year 2008. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the situation the U.S. side is to blame for all the problems related to the implementation of the agreed framework. It is quite natural that the U.S. side should make compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed construction of the lwrs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite unfair to try to unilaterally force the inspection of the nuclear facilities upon the DPRK, a victim, ignoring all the facts and truth. This is, in the final analysis, a criminal attempt to put political pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fate of the agreed framework entirely depends upon the attitude of the U.S. side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and adopt a substantial measure to make an immediate compensation for the loss of electricity to the DPRK before anything else.    \r\n\r\n"

It served as a highly important guideline in setting up the man-centred, best public health system in Korea and accelerating the building of Juche-based socialist public health, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The universal, free medical care, he noted, is a popular measure that could be adopted only by the president who devoted his all to the people, guided by the maxim \"believing in the people as in heaven\" and the most vivid expression of his unbounded love for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wise guidance of the Workers' Party of Korea resulted in adopting the public health law of the DPRK in Juche 69 (1980) and providing a legal guarantee for the final settlement of the issue of the health care of the working masses, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il indicated the orientation and way of putting the public health care onto a higher level to meet the new requirements of the developing revolution and took one wise measure after another to develop the universal, free medical care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today in Korea the mortality rate decreased as low as to one-fourth as compared with that before the liberation of Korea in August 1945 and the average life expectancy nearly doubled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to boost medical services, improve in a revolutionary way the diagnosis and medical treatment methods to meet the demands of the developing modern science and technology and fully ensure the material conditions needed for medical service and thus effect a new revolutionary turn in health care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were secretary Choe Thae Bok of the WPK central committee and other leading officials.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
