            "content": "Spokesman of DPRK FM on issue of Pyongyang visit of U.S. special envoy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- As far as the Pyongyang visit of a U.S. special envoy is concerned, the issue presented itself as the U.S. side proposed it to explain its stand toward the resumption of dialogue. Our stand is to receive him. If the U.S. side has any unavoidable reason, we do not care whether it reconsiders the issue and acts at its convenience.\r\n A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry said this, answering a question put by KCNA today concerning the misinformation floated by the U.S. about the results of the ministerial contact made in Brunei Darussalam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the results of the contact between the DPRK foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state during the 9th ministerial meeting of the ASEAN regional forum some time ago, there are rumors that North Korea's description of the proposed Pyongyang visit of a U.S. special envoy as an established fact was overstatement of their meeting during a coffee break and dialogue would be pursued depending on words and acts of North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We made it clear at the Brunei ministerial contact that we welcomed the U.S. side's reiteration of its intention to dispatch its special envoy to Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Who will be sent by the U.S. as its special envoy and when is its business. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point is for the United States to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and if not, there would be nothing to expect from the dialogue though it is held.    \r\n\r\n"

The day of students' action was set to demand a trial of GI murderers at the South Korean court, the immediate transfer of U.S. Forces' jurisdiction to South Korea, total revision of the South Korea-U.S. status of forces agreement, an official apology from bush and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.\r\n On the purport of this action day, the organization said that the U.S. Forces have turned down the demand for the transfer of jurisdiction, misleading the public opinion though 50 days have passed since the murder of young schoolgirls and, accordingly, students have resolved to get a sincere apology from Bush and punish GI murderers at the court. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such actions will be co-sponsored by the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils, the South Korean Council for Solidarity among Students, the Students Committee of the Democratic Workers' Party, the South Korean Council of Student Representatives of Normal Universities, the South Korean Council of Girl Student Representatives, the South Korean Christian Youth and Students Alliance, the South Korean Christian Students Federation, the South Korean Buddhist Students Alliance and the South Korean Alliance of Traveling Students, it added.  \r\n\r\n"

The full implementation of the declaration is just what Hanchongryon has called for, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying real enemy-benefiting organization is none other than the United States and anti-reunification forces following the outsiders, they pointed to the unreasonableness of labeling Hanchongryon as an \"enemy-benefiting organization\" and detaining its chairman Kim Hyong Ju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the visitors demanded an interview with the chief of the prison and a meeting with Kim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the prison side refused to accept their demand, they staged a demonstration for about 7 hours until it was met. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The students fiercely clashed with riot police attempting to crack down on their demonstration.     \r\n\r\n"

It has three locks through which 2,000 ton-, 20,000 ton- and 50,000 ton-vessels can pass. As a result, a large artificial lake capable of holding 2.7 billion metric tons of water appeared in the lower reaches of the river. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its operation made it possible to supply 2 billion metric tons of irrigation, industrial and drinking water to areas along the west coast every year.
