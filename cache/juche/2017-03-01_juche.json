            "content": "U.S., S. Korea's Absurd Sophism against DPRK over Its Citizen's Death abroad Blasted\r\nPyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- It is half a month since Kim Chol, a citizen of the DPRK bearing a diplomatic passport, died in Malaysia on Feb. 13.\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of his death has not yet been clearly identified but the U.S. and the south Korean authorities are groundlessly blaming the DPRK, asserting that he was intoxicated by highly poisonous VX nerve substance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The absurdity of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities' assertion and lack of its scientific accuracy and logical coherence are proven even by comments made by experts and media of other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is view of chemists of many countries that even a drop of VX may claim deaths of tens or hundreds of people and it has strong permeability and stability as its properties. They asserted a claim that the woman suspect was safe because she washed her hands at a washroom does not correspond with the chemical property of VX. They added that even if the persons suspected of murder had been injected with atropine, basic antidote of VX, they might have fallen into shock and that even if they had worn gloves, this fatal substance would have been extremely dangerous. It is, therefore, the height of absurdity to claim that the person who applied VX, a substance fatal to the life even in case of inhalation of a tiny amount of it or its touch of skin, was left unaffected and the person to whom it was applied met a death, they asserted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t World media query that if component of VX was allegedly detected from Kim Chol's eyes and lips, the ambulance that carried him and police who guarded him must have all been intoxicated and if so, the airport should have been closed but it is still in operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Experts on international law and analysts said that under a regulation of the international organization on ban on chemical weapons, a final conclusion on the results of analysis of chemical weapons can be drawn only on the basis of the identical results of analysis made by at least two specialized laboratories, stressing that the recent case should have been reported to the organization and the relevant sample should have been analyzed at a lab designated by the organization. They further contended that if the use of VX were true, it would be necessary to probe where the substance was from, who made it and who handed it. Drawing any conclusion about VX without any concrete study would be unscientific and if some countries try to use it for other political purposes, the consequences will be beyond imagination, they warned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some media suspect that in view of the fact that the women arrested as suspected murderers had visited south Korea several times in the past, it is highly possible that the south Korean authorities let them carry the said substance. This is by no means fortuitous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Almost all countries have scrapped chemical weapons under the convention on ban on chemical weapons but only the U.S. and some other countries still possess the said substance. What is all the more problematic is the fact that the U.S. is introducing into south Korea all kinds of chemical weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the U.S. and the south Korean authorities are kicking up an anti-DPRK smear campaign, groundlessly pulling it up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the beginning the south Korean authorities spread rumor that the \"death of Kim Chol was intoxication by two women secret agents sent by General Reconnaissance Bureau of north Korea\" and \"their dead bodies will appear\", causing confusion and driving a wedge between the DPRK and Malaysia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lately they tried to use Kim Chol's death for their stepped-up racket of \"human rights\" against the DPRK and floated the story about \"use of chemical weapons\" or \"use of WMD\" by someone in a bid to create atmosphere of \"international criticism\" of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless moves of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities are aimed to meet the dangerous political purpose to tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK and bring down the social system in it. This is clear to everyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger and gravity of the problem lie in that the story about \"use of chemical weapons\" touted by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities has something in common with the story of \"Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction\" spread by the U.S. in the 1990s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the final aim sought by the U.S. to stir up international repugnancy towards the DPRK, lay an international siege for putting pressure on it and provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., however, is mistaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. and the south Korean authorities keep resorting to political chicanery to bring down the social system in the DPRK, being lost to reasons, the DPRK will be compelled to take stronger measures for self-defence in order to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its vassal forces should not run amuck, clearly understanding the strategic position of the DPRK as a nuclear power."

Agregan que aunque las sospechosas del asesinato se hubieran inyectado la atropina, antidoto principal de VX, se habrian dado un choque. Aun en el caso de que la hayan usado con guantes, resulta tambien extremada peligrosa esa sustancia mortifera, especifican. Es el climax de sofisteria decir que salio ilesa la persona quien supuestamente, ha untado la mano con esa sustancia, que causa el peligro de vida por la ingestion de la minima cantidad o el contacto de piel, pero si murio la otra a quien fue aplicada la misma, evaluan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos medios de prensa del mundo reportan que si fue extraida la sustancia VX en los ojos y labios de Kim Chol, esto significa que fueron intoxicados el personal medico de la ambulancia, que le ha transportado, y todos los policias que le custodiaban. Como se puede explicar la operacion continua del aeropuerto que debio haber sido cerrado si fuera tan grave el incidente, ironizan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos especialistas en el derecho internacional y los analistas insisten en que el reglamento de la organizacion internacional de prohibicion de armas quimicas estipula que la conclusion final sobre el resultado de analisis de un arma quimica debe basarse en la misma conclusion que se de al menos en mas de dos laboratorios especializados. Por lo tanto, hay que informar el presente caso a la organizacion internacional de prohibicion de armas quimicas y enviar la muestra correspondiente a los laboratorios indicados por ella, senalan y aseveran que si fuera verdad el uso de VX, hay que averiguar de que pais se ha introducido esa sustancia y quien la ha hecho y quien la ha transferido. No seria cientifico definirla como VX sin hacer estudios detallados y si algunos paises tratan de emplear el incidente en otro objetivo politico, se produciran consecuencias inimaginables, advierten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que algunos medios de prensa sospecharan la posibilidad de que las autoridades surcoreanas les hayan entregado esa sustancia a las sospechosas del asesinato, al tomar en cuenta el hecho de que ellas estuvieron en varias ocasiones en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud del convenio de prohibicion de armas quimicas, casi todos los paises cancelaron estos artefactos, pero EE.UU. y algunos paises tienen la sustancia mencionada y el imperio ha emplazado en suelo surcoreano las armas quimicas de varios tipos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a los hechos arriba mencionados, EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas recurren obstinadamente a su histerica e intrigante campana contra la RPDC acusandola sin razonamientos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el principio, las autoridades surcoreanas crearon confusion difundiendo rumores falsos como que \"Kim Chol murio envenenado por 2 agentes del Buro General de Reconocimiento del Norte de Corea\" y \"apareceran los cadaveres de ellas\". De esta manera, intentaron sembrar cizanas entre la RPDC y Malasia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente, tratan de utilizar la muerte de Kim Chol en su campana anti-RPDC en la esfera de DDHH y crear la atmosfera de \"condena internacional\" a la RPDC con la version sobre el \"uso de armas quimicas y las otras de exterminio masivo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResulta evidente que tal conducta imprudente persigue el peligroso objetivo politico de manchar la imagen de la muy digna RPDC y derrocar su regimen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo peligroso y grave del problema reside en que el rumor de \"uso de armas quimicas\", que difunden EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas, es identico al otro de \"posesion de armas de exterminio masivo por Iraq\" preconizado por EE.UU. en la decada de 1990.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio tiene la meta final de crear en la arena internacional el veto y el cerco de presion contra la RPDC y desatar a toda costa la guerra nuclear contra ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, EE.UU. esta equivocado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas siguen recurriendo al complot politico para derrumbar el regimen de la RPDC, esta tomara las medidas de autodefensa mas fuertes para defender su soberania y dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y sus satelites deben actuar con prudencia al ver bien la posicion estrategica de la RPDC que se ha situado en la primera fila de potencias nucleares."
