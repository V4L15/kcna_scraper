Chopra, chairman of the Indian Intellectuals' Society for the Study of the Juche Idea, noted that the Korean people have firmly protected the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country from the evermore intensified U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK as they have been guided by the Juche philosophy. \r\n Screened at the film shows were Korean films including \"The Brilliant History of the Great Leadership\" and \"The Old Home in Mt.

Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in an editorial carried on the occasion of the 87th anniversary of the March 1 Popular Uprising.\r\n The March 1 Popular Uprising was an anti-Japanese patriotic struggle which proved that the Korean people were a people strong in the spirit of independence as they refused to be slaves of others and a brave and justice-loving people who fought against the aggressors and oppressors braving any sacrifices, the editorial notes, and goes on:\r\n Many years have passed since the uprising but the struggle of the Korean nation to put an end to the foreign aggression and domination and achieve the complete independence and sovereignty of the country and the nation is not over. \r\n It is the important task facing the Korean nation to oppose foreign forces' aggression and intervention, defend the sovereignty and security of the nation and achieve the independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK and their moves to start a new war and intensify their domination over south Korea and their interference in its internal affairs are the main factor of encroaching upon the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation and blocking the peace of the country and its independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are escalating their vicious moves against the DPRK while zealously joining the U.S. in its moves to stifle the DPRK, far from making an apology and compensation for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean nation in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for waging a dynamic patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" in order to check and frustrate foreign forces' brigandish moves for aggression and war and defend the sovereignty and security of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The above-mentioned judgment was made as an extension of its anti-Chongryon moves, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' desperate moves against Chongryon are aimed to stamp out Chongryon and realize their ambition to stage a comeback to Korea without fail.\r\n The DPRK will never look with folded arms on Japan's unjustifiable suppression of Chongryon. Japan should stop those wicked moves against Chongryon at once, deeply mindful of this. If Japan persists in these actions against Chongryon, it will be entirely accountable for the ensuing grave consequences.          \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The pent-up national resentment and a deep-rooted rancor of the Korean people against the aggressors burst into a nation-wide anti-Japanese resistance on March 1, Juche 8 (1919).\r\n The March First Popular Uprising started with a mass independence demonstration in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A representative of youth and students read out the \"Declaration of Independence\" before thousands of people at the school playground on Jangdae Hill, solemnly declaring that Korea was an independent state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day in Seoul, too, an anti-Japanese demonstration took place, the participants of which totaled hundreds of thousands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Governor-general Hasegawa mobilized armed forces to mercilessly put down the demonstration. Streets of Seoul turned into a sea of blood in an instant. The demonstrators marched forward over their fellows who fell down, keeping the ranks. When a young girl student had her right arm that held the national flag cut off by an enemy sword, she took the flag in her left hand and, when she was unable to move any further having had her left arm cut off, too, she continued to shout \"Long live the independence of Korea!\" striking terror into the hearts of the Japanese imperialist soldiers and policemen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The flames of the uprising spread all over the 13 provinces of the country.\r\n The uprising, which gradually assumed a violent character, was participated in by more than two million people of all strata by the end of May. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of demonstrations and riots that took place across the country till December that year amounted to more than 3,200. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the uprising which lasted nearly a year, over one hundred thousands of demonstrators were killed at the point of bayonet of the Japanese imperialist soldiers and policemen. Nearly 46,700 patriotic people were imprisoned in the homeland only on May 31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The March First Popular Uprising, which ended in a failure owing to the brutal suppression by the Japanese imperialists, taught the Korean revolutionaries and patriotic people a bloody lesson that they should encounter the armed enemies with an organizational armed struggle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Cooperation with Outside Forces in War Moves under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- The DPRK will never tolerate such pro-U.S. sycophantic and treacherous acts of the south Korean warlike military forces as hamstringing the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, bedeviling the inter-Korean relations to drive the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war by cooperating with foreign aggressor forces in their war moves, Rodong Sinmun today warns this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities are persistently involved in the U.S. war exercises targeted against the north under the signboards of \"PSI\" and \"Ulji Focus Lens.\" They are tightening the military collusion and nexus with the U.S. by agreeing on the \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea. This is nothing but a foolish and suicidal act to encourage the U.S. imperialist warlike quarters in the war moves against the north and start a war on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n \"Cooperation\" with foreign aggressor forces only leads to the escalation of military tension, stokes distrust and confrontation among compatriots, blocks the process to warm up the inter-Korean relations and results in the outbreak of a war against compatriots in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Cooperation\" with outside forces in war moves, conspiracy and collusion with aggressors is an unpardonable perfidy as it runs counter to the basic spirit of the historical June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea's continued \"cooperation\" with outside forces in war moves may disturb peace on the Korean Peninsula and have an irretrievable serious impact on the development of the inter-Korean relations. \"Cooperation\" with outside forces in war moves can never be justified as it is aimed at scrapping the June 15 joint declaration and hamstringing its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Military conspiracy and collusion with outside forces is little short of a very dangerous war gambling as it can trigger off a war against the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Joint Declaration of North and South Sides Published\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party and the Council for the Reunification of Tangun's Nation from the north side and the Society for the Reunification of Tonghak's Nation and the General Federation of National Movement Camp from the south side published a joint declaration in which they agreed to set the period of the three-point patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity till November 17 when the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" was fabricated by the Japanese imperialists and wage a dynamic joint struggle.\r\n The joint declaration was published in Pyongyang and Seoul Wednesday on the occasion of the 87th anniversary of the patriotic March 1 Popular Uprising.\r\n The joint declaration bitterly denounced Japan for working hard to stage a comeback to Korea, far from making an apology and compensation for the crimes committed by it against the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will conduct a valiant movement for independent reunification against foreign forces so as to dynamically advance along the road of independent reunification this year while giving full play to the spirit of attaching importance to the nation, the Korean nation-first spirit, placing the dignity and interests of the nation above anything else, true to the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the joint declaration noted.\r\n Calling upon all the Koreans to turn out as one in the patriotic movement for peace against war, it said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of nuclear disasters is increasing on this land day by day due to outside forces and Japan is escalating its moves for militarization by availing itself of this opportunity. Only when all the fellow countrymen turn out in the struggle for peace against war in a do-or-die spirit at this juncture is it possible to prevent disasters of a nuclear war and bring a rosy future of national reunification.\r\n Stressing the need to take the lead in the movement for great national unity, it said:\r\n In order to foil the collusion and challenge of the treacherous conservatives and achieve the dignity of the nation, all the national movement forces and reunification movement organizations in the north and the south should achieve positive solidarity and alliance and transcend the difference in religious beliefs, political groupings and affiliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We ardently call upon the 70 million Koreans to achieve the great national unity under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration this year and thus vigorously pave a new wide avenue for accomplishing the cause of national reunification, it concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
