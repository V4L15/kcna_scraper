Among the dead were children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such killing by U.S. troops has been seen in Afghanistan, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than GIs who ran an armored car over Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son, middle schoolgirls of south Korea, on June 13, 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For some ten years from the Gulf War in 1991 to air-raids on Serbia and Montenegro in 1999, military action in Afghanistan and war of aggression against Iraq in 2003, the U.S. showered new-type missiles and bombs over civilians, killing a large number of children. It used without hesitation napalm and cluster bombs and even depleted uranium bullets which have been banned internationally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is urgent for all nations to put an early period to the high-handed practice of the United States, build a new independent world and protect the precious dream of the children with concerted efforts.    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

It claims that the politico-economic confusion in other countries would give rise to \"terrorism\", \"international crimes\", \"illegal emigration\", etc. and, therefore, \"democratic politics\", \"economic opening,\" and \"guarantee of human rights\" are necessary, and it lays them down as the main condition for its \"aid.\" A typical example is what it calls \"Mid-east proposal.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That the U.S. \"aid\" is a means of its strategy for dominating the world is well proved by its content. In case of its \"aid\" to some countries, it is mainly \"military aid\" and in case of other forms of \"aid\" to other countries the U.S. defines its use or demands its own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thus, the U.S. \"aid\" is an important means for its strategy of world supremacy. In the countries which failed to see through the reactionary nature of the U.S. \"aid\" and received it, the national economy has gone bankrupt and their people's living has became more difficult and these countries are eventually falling into the abyss of political and economic dependence on the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is loudmouthed about its \"aid\" being conducive to the social and economic development of other countries, but, in fact, it results in the decline and ruin of the national economy, political confusion and disorder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is clearly evidenced by the realities of the East European countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Illusion about and expectation for the U.S. \"aid\" immediately lead to dependence and national ruin. All the countries desirous of peace and progress should see through the poisonous nature and danger of the U.S. \"aid\" and heighten their vigilance against it and solve all the problems arising in social life by their own strength and efforts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

At around 09:25 it repeatedly threatened over a loud-speaker peaceable fishing boats of the north side in their normal fishing operation that it would fire at them if they did not go back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the same time it let fighters fly in a two-plane formation several times above Yonphyong Islands, threatening the north side's fishing boats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such military provocations are nothing but premeditated provocations of the south Korean military authorities to deliberately escalate again the tension in the controversial waters where two skirmishes occurred in the West Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such military provocations are a continuation of the recent evermore undisguised intrusion of south Korean warships into the territorial waters of the north side.
