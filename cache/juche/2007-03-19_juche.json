With such remnants left intact, it is impossible to ensure peace and security in Asia, including the Korean Peninsula, and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war gambles are an unpardonable crime against peace and reunification as they chill the burning desire of the Korean nation for reunification and block inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also go against the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ruling quarters' moves to intensify war games in south Korea are aimed to poison the atmosphere of the talks and drive the situation of the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war. Their real intention is to while away the time with the six-party talks and ignite a war against the DPRK when a chance is given. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war drills in and around south Korea are contrary to the spirit and mission of the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be an anachronistic daydream if the U.S. calculates that it can overpower the army and people of the DPRK and bring them into submission by military pressure or force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready for both war and talks.

Korea Urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- It is imperative to put an end to the U.S. policy of domination over Korea and its policy of occupation of south Korea in order to defend peace on the Korean Peninsula and achieve its peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula remains one of the world hot spots where a tense situation always prevails and fraught with the greatest danger of war as the U.S. occupied south Korea and has persistently pursued a policy of aggression against peace, keeping south Korea under its occupation as its base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military bases in south Korea serve the purposes of the U.S. policy towards Korea and its policy of war of aggression against Asia as bridgeheads, advance bases for invading the DPRK and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., considering it a fait accompli to launch the second Korean war, is set to start a new war of aggression with the U.S. military bases in south Korea as bases of sortie, logistic bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is going to start the largest-ever \"Foal Eagle\" and \"RSOI\" joint military exercises soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to justify the presence of its forces in south Korea, zealously painting them as a \"protector,\" \"champion\" that ensures security and protects peace in Northeast Asia. The U.S. schemes to reorganize its forces in south Korea into \"regional forces\" by equipping them with the weapons of latest type tested in the Iraqi war in a bid to use them as forces for war of aggression against Asia to realize its domination and control over Asia. This is aimed at perpetuating the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should force the U.S. troops, a cancer-like entity, to quit south Korea through nationwide anti-U.S. resistance under the banner of \"By our nation itself.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Work Marked\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- Papers Saturday dedicate articles to the 10th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's historic work \"On Learning from the Revolutionary Soldier Spirit\" published on March 17, Juche 86 (1997). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary soldier spirit serves as an invincible treasured sword of Songun Korea, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This spirit is the starting point from which the Workers' Party of Korea has made the history of overall victories with its Songun politics. The might of the Songun politics is just the might of the revolutionary soldier spirit, and the history of its great victory is annals in which the spirit has been fully embodied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the great spirit of improving a human being in every aspect whereby all the Korean people have been turned to be ardent fighters in the Songun era. It is also the spirit of epoch-making creation and feat and the staunch spirit of defending the country as it helped bring about the dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation in this land, withstanding stern trials, and reliably defend Korean-style socialism in the fierce confrontation with the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the might of this spirit, the Korean people have consolidated the DPRK's political and ideological and military positions as firm as a rock. It is an eternal wealth that makes it possible for our country to display its dignity as an invincible power for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is a man of faith and will, a man with plenty of guts and the supreme incarnation of human love who has got everything by believing and relying on the servicepersons and people. He is also the supreme model of revolutionary optimists with the most steadfast view on the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has clearly showed what idea and faith the revolutionary should keep in mind while leading our army and people to live and struggle in the revolutionary soldier spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has always overcome any grave hardships standing in the way of revolution with his absolute trust in the servicepersons and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Love the future!\" and \"Live not merely for today but for tomorrow\"-- this is his view on the future. This spirit of optimism helped train soldiers of the Korean People's Army to be indomitable combatants, produce a large army of optimists and make the militant stamina prevail all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary soldier spirit is an ever-victorious banner that our army and people should hold high forever. As an eternal banner of struggle and victory for the Korean revolution, it is the Paektu revolutionary spirit of today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the servicepersons and people should not forget even a moment that the present of prospering Songun Korea and its bright future are guaranteed by Kim Jong Il. They should embody the spirit of devotedly defending the leader in every aspect of their work and life and become heroes of the Songun era by cherishing deep in mind the call of the country and the era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the revolutionary soldier spirit, an ideological and moral basis of the spirit of Thaechon (displayed by the builders of the Thaechon Power Station), has served as a driving force for prosperous development of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is an intolerable insult to the justice and ethics and morality and an act of going against history as these remarks are intended to connive at and encourage the war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in an article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Admission to the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army and apology for them serve as a barometer to discern whether Japan admits to the past aggression of the Japanese imperialists or not, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are making desperate efforts to deny the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army still today, more than 60 years since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said reckless remarks made by the Japanese reactionaries totally denying the forcible recruitment of the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army and its involvement in it were not prompted by the feelings of any individual or the lack of understanding of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desperate bid made by the Japanese authorities to grossly distort and whitewash the history of the bloody wars ignited by their forefathers despite the unanimous rebuff and denunciation from the international community is aimed at reviving militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army are nothing but an icon betraying Japan's aggressive nature, brutality and vulgarity and the greatest national disgrace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will meet international isolation and disgraceful destruction only if it opts for re-aggression, denying its past war crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an intolerable insult to the victims and their bereaved families and an unpardonable challenge to the whole Korean nation and the international community demanding an apology and compensation for the crimes. Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind his reckless remarks distorting historical facts and denying the forced recruitment of the \"comfort women\" is a sinister intention to tide over the crisis of his rule and push forward the militarization of Japan for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This suggests that Japan is set to stage a comeback to Korea to repeat such hideous state-sponsored crimes in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His outbursts self-exposed how shameless the Japanese ruling quarters are and they remain unchanged in their aggressive and brutal nature peculiar to Japan and have become more pronounced in this nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These samurais took away hundreds of thousands of Korean women to coerce them into doing sexual servitude for the imperial Japanese army and drove millions of young and middle-aged Koreans to battle fields and forced labor sites, killing many of them. It is, therefore, nonsensical for them to talk about \"abduction\" and \"sanctions\" against someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon the oft-repeated provocative remarks made by the ruling quarters of Japan, but fully disclose the crimes perpetrated by Japan and force it to pay a dear price for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The world public has hailed this development and expressed hope that the countries concerned would take this hard-won opportunity to stir up the atmosphere of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. projected the above-said military maneuvers against its dialogue partner against this backdrop, which clearly indicates who is chiefly responsible for the mounting tension on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to justify the above-said provocative saber-rattling, describing it as something for \"defence\" and the like, but this is nothing but a cheap trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nobody's secret that the U.S. military worked out an \"emergency scenario for an attack upon the DPRK\" under the pretext of coping with the new development after the DPRK's successful nuclear test and has since stepped up in real earnest with the preparations for mounting a surprise attack on major facilities in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to these deceptive and adventurous moves of the U.S. dark clouds of a war are hanging over the Korean Peninsula quite contrary to the expectation of the international community. U.S. imperialist aggression troops and their ultra-modern military hardware have been massively deployed in and around the peninsula after being transferred there from their U.S. mainland and its overseas bases. U.S. fighter bombers are busy with navigation and air battle drills and exercises for striking targets on the ground and familiarizing themselves with terrain in the sky above south Korea almost every day. On Mar. 13 and 14 alone dozens of U.S. mainland-based \"F-117\" Stealth fighter bombers staged madcap air battle exercises in the skies over North and South Jolla and Kyonggi provinces and south Korean Kangwon Province and Oeyon, Anma and Jik islets in the West Sea, while being refueled in the air. All these war moves are a prelude to the \"largest-ever\" RSOI and Foal Eagle projected by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the U.S. is only watching for a chance to invade the DPRK, refusing to abandon its attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, though it is talking about dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue and war maneuvers can never go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are fully prepared to deal merciless crushing blows at the aggressors, not forgetting the U.S. arrogant nature even a moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by their double-dealing tactics and give up their foolish attempt.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Un gran numero de efectivos y equipos militares sofisticados norteamericanos se trasladan del mismo territorio de EE.UU. y las bases ultramarinas de este a la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno y los bombarderos norteamericanos sobrevuelan casi a diario la region surcoreana para realizar ejercicios de navegacion, combate aereo, golpe a los objetos terrestres y familiarizacion con las condiciones topograficas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los dias 13 y 14, decenas de cazabombarderos \"F-117\" procedentes del territorio norteamericano, al abastecerse del combustible en el aire, efectuaron los ejercicios de combate aereo en las provincias de Jolla del Sur y del Norte, de Kyonggi y Kangwon del Sur de Corea, y las islas de Oeyon, Anma y Jik de la costa occidental.
