Japan's act of supporting and shielding the U.S. use of weapons of mass destruction indicates that it will leave no means untried for overseas aggression as the U.S. does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese authorities are well advised to bear in mind that if they continue acting blindly to the tune of the U.S. out of their senses, they will only meet a fatal fiasco.    \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this, commenting on the meeting which was opened here on may 23.\r\n The news analyst observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting the head of the north side's delegation expressed deep concern over the fact that the south side in the \"joint statement\" published with the U.S. agreed with \"further steps\" which the world people interpreted as a blockade and military attack and worried about. If this actually happens to spark confrontation, the relations between the north and the south will be put at the lowest ebb and this will bring disasters to the south side, too, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side, however, created complexities at the meeting and delayed the discussion, talking about \"clarification.\" Who on earth is committed to clarify and apologize? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was very disappointing that the south side behaved like a guilty party filing the suit first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What was alarming was that the south side did not bother to spread misinformation about the meeting, quoting an anonymous \"high-ranking official of Chongwadae\" even before the meeting came to an end. This clearly proves how perfidious and uneasy the south side was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side should think over its improper acts of going against the idea of \"by our nation itself,\" the basic spirit of the June 15 Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But they argued that this report was misinterpreted or not confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They went to the lengths of telling a lie that the DPRK could not but come out to the Beijing talks as china kept the oil pipe blocked for three days. As this propaganda did not sound plausible they are these days bringing up again non-existent issues of the DPRK's \"counterfeit money\" and \"drug trafficking,\" their trite tricks, in a bid to fool the world community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have already clarified that the rumor about \"exile of vice-department director Kil Jae Gyong\" was a sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is true of the recent report that \"20 nuclear scientists of the DPRK sought asylum in the United States and other countries via China.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the scientists of the DPRK are strong in revolutionary faith. They are devotedly working for the building of a great prosperous power. They can't do such a thing as they are ideologically ready to share the same destiny with their socialist homeland to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the issue of reprocessing spent fuel rods is concerned, the DPRK made it clear on April 18 that it was successfully carrying out the work of reprocessing over 8,000 spent rods at the final stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, dishonest forces argued this was misinterpreted and not confirmed. Such allegation reminds one of the ostrich policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their talk about \"oil pipe\" does not deserve even a passing note as it is a sheer fabrication invented to drive a wedge between the DPRK and China in the development of relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is true of \"counterfeit money\" and \"drug trafficking\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned practices are strictly prohibited under our socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the rumors spread by plot-breeders of the united states, styling itself the only superpower of the world, and South Korea are no more than a sinister trick to tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK, find a pretext to impose international sanctions and blockade on it and cause psychological unrest in its society in a bid to break the singlehearted unity of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. considers the psychological war very important in the U.S. hostile moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK over the \"nuclear issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims that it achieved \"success\" in the Iraqi war through a deceptive, hypocritical and cunning psychological war, something it could hardly gain by use of hi-tech weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt seeks to use this method against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But such psychological war of the U.S. is not workable in the DPRK where the people are singleheartedly united, though it could work in the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, a key to removing the confrontation between the two countries over the nuclear issue, at an early date, far from trying to undermine our system through such war as foolish an act as sweeping the see with a broom.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-hearted unity serves as a source of the vitality of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of the community linked with the same destiny is a great idea which has developed in depth the theory on the driving force of the revolution on a new higher plane. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The driving force of the revolution means an integral whole of the headquarters, the party, the army and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strengthening the driving force of the revolution, in essence, means closely rallying the party, the army and the people around the headquarters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As shown by the historical lesson, if the unity of the party, the army and the people around the headquarters of the revolution breaks, even strong military and economic power will prove ineffective and socialism collapse. This is the reason why the unity serves as a main source of the vitality of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-hearted unity serves as a solid political basis of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This basis means a political force supporting socialism. in other words, it means the army and people closely rallied around the headquarters of the revolution. The army is the main player. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the biggest weak point of the preceding theory that it failed to regard the army as an important political force of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-hearted unity serves as a powerful engine for the development of the socialist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The engine of the socialist construction is built by the political and ideological might of the driving force of the revolution and the revolutionary enthusiasm and the creative zeal of the army and people united close behind the party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the revolutionary army makes a breakthrough in the most difficult and important fields true to the idea and policy of the party and all the people fully display the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative zeal learning from the army's revolutionary spirit and militant trait, it is possible to vigorously accelerate socialist construction under any difficult circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the immutable truth clearly proved in the most rigorous test of the revolution that single-hearted unity serves as a source of vitality of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the headquarters of the revolution is the core of the unity, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the single-hearted unity is the main source of the vitality of socialism, the headquarters of the revolution is the very core of the single-hearted unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party, the army and the people form a harmonious whole united around the headquarters of the revolution. This is the main feature of the single-hearted unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The driving force of the revolution is a social and political organism in which the headquarters, the party, the army and the people are united as an organic body and its core is the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The destinies of the headquarters of the revolution, the party, the army and the people are inseparably linked with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the party, the army and the people are under the steermanship of the great headquarters, can they display invincible might and enjoy independent dignity and life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the headquarters of the revolution is absolutely trusted by the party, the army and the people, can it creditably fulfil its mission and role as a political leader steering the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party, the army and the people form an integral whole as they unanimously worship and follow the headquarters of the revolution as the sun taking care of their lives while the headquarters deeply trusts and leads them as revolutionary comrades with whom it shares the same destiny. This represents the single-hearted unity, the strongest of the unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outstanding idea, experienced leadership and noble human trait of the great headquarters serve as a fundamental factor of the single-hearted unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As flowers bloom thanks to the sun, the single-hearted unity has been achieved on this socialist land thanks to the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-hearted unity of the party, the army and the people around the headquarters of the revolution serves as the most powerful weapon of revolution. Any formidable imperialist enemy can be defeated and a great prosperous socialist power built even from debris only if there is the steel-strong single-hearted unity of the headquarters of the revolution, the party, the army and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The glorious Korean revolution has achieved the single-hearted unity of the party, the army and the people and won one victory after another thanks to it as the revolution held President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il in high esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls for fully demonstrating the might of this community linked with the same destiny. \r\n The whole party and army and all the people should devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution and strengthen the single-hearted unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for frustrating the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and devotedly defending the socialist homeland, the article underscores the need to consolidate the anti-imperialist military front, the lifeline of Korean-style socialism, to be a steel-strong fortress, remaining single-heartedly true to Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
