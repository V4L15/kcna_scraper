He regards the servicemen as the driving force of the armed forces and wisely guided them to Fully play their role as masters, training them as a strong army.\r\n   He, who grew up, inheriting the morale of the brilliant commander's family, is deeply versed in the military.\r\n   One day, he visited a shooting range of the People's Army and showed the shooters how to hit the target right. He hit ten bottles 50 metres away with a pistol, five by the right hand and another five by the left hand. He then told the commanding officers and those who were accompanying him that officers may be wounded in right hand in battles so they should train left-hand shooting, too.\r\n   When he visited a tank unit, he personally got in a tank and showed tankers how to operate the tank on slope and said tanks should be reshaped so that they may cross over big or small rivers.\r\n   In a summer day, he went to an airfield and knew that commanding officers found it very difficult to ensure safe landing of a plane because of unexpected change of weather. \r\n   Learning that the plane was due to land from the northern direction, he personally guided the plane to reach the ground from the southern direction. That time, there were lightning flashes and heavy showers in the northern sky but the southern sky was clear. As soon as the plane reached ground safely, there were thunders and flashes in the southern sky, too. The officers were deeply moved by his able commanding in a critical condition.\r\n   When he called at a naval base, he joined seamen in voyage and planted the spirit of brave attack and combat in their minds with a complicated charter. And when he visited a munitions plant, he indicated ways of improving and completing military equipment as required by the Juche-based war method and by the situation.\r\n   Guided by Secretary Kim Jong Il, Supreme Commander with distinguished intelligence and outstanding commanding art, the Korean People's Army has become an invincible army. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
