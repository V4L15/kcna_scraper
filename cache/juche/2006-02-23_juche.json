It is an obstacle to great national unity, which should be removed as early as possible.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a by-lined article today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NSL, a fascist law against reunification, designates the DPRK as an \"anti-state organization\" and the fellow countrymen as the enemy, opposes national unity and reunification and negates human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only evil law in the world which designates the fellow countrymen as the enemy and incriminates contacts, dialogue, travel and exchange between fellow countrymen. It is extremely abnormal that such law remains in south Korea.\r\n It is due developments that the demand for abolition of the NSL has grown stronger in south Korea in recent years and it is becoming a pending issue at political camp.\r\n Attitude toward the NSL is a touchstone distinguishing those who want great national unity and reunification from those who pursue confrontation and division. It is a deception and mockery of the nation as well as hypocrisy to talk about \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\" without the repeal of the NSL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the NSL remains in south Korea, it is impossible to achieve genuine inter-Korean reconciliation, unity and peaceful reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
