But the Lee Myung Bak regime stubbornly insisted he never made such remarks, glossing over the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the truth about his remarks have been undeniably confirmed as a U.S. diplomatic cable disclosed the specific contents of Lee's remarks which the then first secretary of the south Korean embassy in Tokyo conveyed to an official concerned of the U.S. embassy in Tokyo and his words that he felt feelings of perfidy when hearing those remarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this connection opposition parties and personages of various social strata in south Korea are scathingly condemning the traitor, saying that the rumor afloat four years ago proved to be truth and it is nonsensical and deplorable that the remarks little short of abandoning Tok Islets were made by him. Media are also making a big uproar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pro-Japanese treacherous remarks made by Lee amount to an official promise made by him before his master that he would abandon the sovereignty over Tok Islets, part of the inviolable territory of the Korean nation from the historical and geographical points of view, and hand them over to Japan when the time comes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is sparking off towering resentment among all Koreans as it is a despicable sycophantic and treacherous act little short of what \"the five traitors of 1905\" did as they sold off the country to Japanese imperialism 100 odd years ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, the Lee group has drawn water to Japan's mill for reinvasion of Korea by conniving at and encouraging the Japanese reactionaries in their moves to grab the islets through its disgraceful diplomacy of submission to Japan and pro-Japanese sycophancy and treachery ever since it came to power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever they marked the islets as part of Japan's territory in the white paper for defense and committed such brigandish act as distorting history textbooks, the Lee group has never properly taken issue with those practices with a vague attitude, asserting that \"south Korea should not be involved in a dispute\" and it is better to conduct \"quiet diplomacy\" and exercise \"self-restraint\".  When the south Korean Maritime Institute was to set up the Tok Islets General Maritime Scientific Base, the group forced it to delete the expression of Tok Islets from the name, saying it may get on Japan's nerves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year it did not hesitate to commit such treachery as opening Ullung Islet close to Tok Islets under the pretext of \"tourism\" to the Japanese reactionaries keen to stretch out tentacles of reinvasion of Ullung Islet in a bid to grab Tok Islets at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are now becoming all the more arrogant in their moves to grab Tok Islets due to such pro-Japanese treacherous acts of the Lee group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His pro-Japanese remarks are unpardonable treacherous crimes as they reveal once again before the world the despicable true colors as the worst traitor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world does not know such vicious traitor as Lee who is resorting to pro-Japanese and pro-U.S. sycophantic acts while standing in confrontation with fellow countrymen with swords and yielding to the sworn enemy of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible for the south Korean people to escape disasters nor is it possible for the nation to escape misfortune as long as the group of sycophants and traitors are allowed to stay in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people have already dealt a sledge hammer blow at the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group would be well advised to bear in mind that only the nation's stern judgment awaits the group engrossed in sycophantic and treacherous acts and confrontation with fellow countrymen."

There he said that Asia is a region where the U.S. has primary interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time, the secretary of Defense and the secretary of State and other high-ranking authorities traveled Asian countries and made much fuss about the \"necessity\" of cooperation and the \"importance\" of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The black-hearted intention of the U.S. was fully disclosed through a new report on military strategy issued in last January.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the report the U.S. clarified that it would decrease the number of armed forces in Europe while making a switchover to increasing the military presence in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to it, the U.S. reached an agreement with Australia to keep its 250 U.S. marines in that country and increase the number of forces to 1 000 in 2014 and 2 500 in 2016. Australia also agreed to let U.S. warships carrying fighters and nuclear weapons use its military base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with this, the chief of operation of the U.S. Navy underscored the necessity to deploy it in the world and declared that it is pushing forward a detailed plan to deploy new type warships in Singapore and Philippines in a few years to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the U.S. recently staged large-scale joint military exercises in the Asia-Pacific region one after another, causing instability and sparking off an arms race in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Xinhua News Agency said that joint military exercises with noisy gunfire are disturbing the stability in the Asia-Pacific region, adding that they are pursuant to long-term strategic aim of the U.S.  It also criticized the U.S. for escalating the tension through this saber-rattling in a bid to maintain and strengthen its hegemonic position in the Asia-Pacific region and realize its strategic ambition for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the U.S. craftily seeks to establish economic domination over the countries in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As part of the plan, the U.S. came out with the TPP and is trying to force it on the countries in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The TPP is, in essence, an agreement advantageous to the U.S. as it is premised on liberalization of trade, agriculture, manufacturing industry, service, etc. and even the removal of not only tariff barrier but also tariff-free barrier in bilateral trade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By keeping markets of countries in the Asia-Pacific region fully open through this agreement so it may get access to them, unhindered, the U.S. seeks to put the key branches of economy in the region under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The facts clearly prove that the U.S. remains unchanged in its wild ambition for domination and its true colors as an aggressor."

They are busy collecting more election funds to occupy Presidency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the amount of election money collected by the candidates in the first three months ending January this year made public by the Federal Election Commission late in January, the incumbent president accumulated about 40 million U.S. dollars, topping the list. Candidate from the Republican Party Mitt Romney collected 24 million U.S. dollars while Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives, collected 9.8 million U.S. dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the tiny handful of ruling quarters are vying with each other to collect election money to seek presidential office, turning a deaf ear to the voices of the toiling masses demanding jobs and bread. This reality glaringly proves that the U.S. has no future."
