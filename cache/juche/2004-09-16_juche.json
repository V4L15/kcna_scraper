Korea Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- The International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea in an appeal issued on Sept. 7, 59 years after the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' occupation of south Korea, called upon all peace-loving and progressive anti-U.S. forces of the world to unite close and turn out in the struggle to force the U.S. to completely pull back its forces and military equipment from south Korea.\r\n Recalling that the U.S. forces landed on south Korea on Sept. 8, 1945 under the pretext of \"disarming the Japanese troops\" and proclaimed a military rule, seizing all civil and military rights, the appeal branded their occupation of south Korea as a violation of the sovereignty and independence of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the last 59 years the U.S. troops have been the root cause of unspeakable misfortune and sufferings of the south Korean people. The desire of the south Korean people for socio-political democracy and the ardent will of all the Koreans in the north, south and overseas for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea can never come true as long as the U.S. forces are present in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The security and peace of the people in Korea and those of the countries around it can never be guaranteed so long as the U.S. forces and their modern combat equipment remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing the projected \"reduction\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea as a deceptive farce, the appeal said the U.S. plans to spend 13 billion dollars for its forces in south Korea for the three years to come according to the \"arms buildup plan\" in a bid to arm its forces with modern military equipment, while cutting down their numerical strength, and then their military potential will grow stronger far from getting weak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the progressive forces should not harbour even the slightest illusion about the \"reduction\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea but turn out in the struggle to eliminate the factors of threatening the reunification and peace of Korea and the security and peace of its people and the rest of the world, the appeal noted.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
