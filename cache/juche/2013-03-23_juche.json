He highly appreciated their success in training and set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for bolstering up the combat capability in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe organized and guided a pistol and automatic rifle firing drill of the battalion commanding officers without prior notice on the same day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that the combatants should acquire marksmanship of never missing targets while preparing themselves politically and ideologically and in militarily technique and physically. He taught the knack of all hits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe instructed the Military Science Documentary Film Studio of the Korean People's Army to produce a video dealing with varieties of shooting methods and send it to the whole army so that the Juche-oriented combat shooting methods may be coordinated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Hyon Yong Chol, Kim Kyok Sik, Hwang Pyong So and Son Chol Ju."

            "content": "ACNC critica la campana anticoreana de reaccionarios japoneses\r\nPyongyang, 23 de marzo (ACNC) -- En estos dias, los reaccionarios japoneses arrecian mas que antes la campana de confrontacion anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl director del secretariado del gabinete dijo en entrevista de prensa que \"estrecharia la red de cerco anti-RPDC\" mientras el jefe de la Junta de Estado Mayor de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" peroro que \"hara todo lo posible en la vigilancia\" a la RPDC hablando de la \"violacion a la resolucion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es un lamento de quienes estan atemorizados ante la voluntad de reaccion intransigente de la RPDC y una manifestacion del intento de recrudecer la campana anti-RPDC sumandose a la politica hostil de Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales disparates coinciden con la presentacion al Senado de EE.UU. del llamado \"informe anual\" que ha descrito el ejercicio del derecho de autodefensa de la RPDC como \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses practicaron obstinadamente en el pasado la campana conflictiva con la RPDC siendo complices activos en la politica hostil de EE.UU. a ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos politicos conservadores de Japon como el director del secretariado del gabinete y el jefe de la Junta de Estado Mayor de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" son capaces de cualquier cosa para adular a su amo gringo y elevar su popularidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl premier japones Abe esta al frente de la demagogia anticoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dijo que \"seria bueno para la RPDC no subestimar las palabras de EE.UU. y cambiar su politica\" y para colmo, se atrevio a mencionar el supuesto \"arruinamiento\" de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales dichos son tan vulgares e indecentes para ser pronunciados por un jefe de Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando numerosos paises del mundo apoyan el ejercicio de derecho de autodefensa de la RPDC, ese premier del pais vecino expone abiertamente su hostilidad y arraigada conciencia conflictiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto muestra su conciencia de confrontacion anti-RPDC y su baja personalidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs tan absurdo el disparate de Abe sobre el \"arruinamiento\" y el \"cambio de politica\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas medidas autodefensivas de la RPDC son las justas tomadas frente a las ilegales hostilidades de EE.UU. y el CS de la ONU que han negado el legitimo derecho de lanzamiento del satelite y la prueba nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHabria que poner en entredicho su cualidad como jefe de Estado si el no supiera esa verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon, que intenta repetir la sangrienta historia del pasado y acelera la conversion en potencia militar con el lanzamiento del satelite espia y otros, critica de una manera u otra las medidas autodefensivas de la RPDC, lo cual es un atentado contra la soberania nacional de otro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una tragedia para Japon que los politicos incapaces como Abe estuvieran en la cima del poder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no perdonaran jamas, como hicieron en el pasado, a los que ofendan la maxima dignidad de la RPDC y hagan chismes sobre las medidas de esta para la defensa de soberania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbe y otros politicos japoneses continuan con su chismografia pensando que pueden estar fuera del alcance de ataque de la RPDC, seran arruinados mas pronto."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun desmiente rumor de \"provocacion del Norte\"\r\nPyongyang, 23 de marzo (ACNC) -- En un articulo individual difundido este sabado, el diario Rodong Sinmun senala que Estados Unidos y los titeres surcoreanos difunden el rumor de la supuesta \"provocacion del Norte (de Corea)\" para justificar su criminal \"sancion\" y belicismo anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, eludir la responsabilidad de la grave situacion actual y eliminar la idea y el regimen de esta, y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\tEse rumor es un sofisma para ocultar la ambicion de agredir a la RPDC al desatar la nueva guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos actos provocativos los cometen ellos mismos que aplican la inaudita \"sancion\" economica contra la RPDC y la presionan cuestionando el ejercicio de su derecho soberano. De esta manera, ellos crean el extremado peligro de guerra movilizando enormes fuerzas armadas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDominar toda la Corea tomando el Sur de Corea como cabeza de puente para la realizacion de su estrategia de hegemonia mundial es la invariable ambicion del imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara justificar la ocupacion y el dominio del Sur de Corea, EE.UU. difunde mas que nunca el rumor de la \"provocacion del Norte\" pretextando el lanzamiento de satelite artificial y la prueba nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere surcoreana se suma al designio de su amo norteamericano de ocupar para siempre el territorio surcoreano y provocar la guerra nuclear anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte la grave realidad de hoy, todos los connacionales y la humanidad pacifista calan bien el caracter enganoso del rumor en cuestion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste rumor tendra como desenlace la tragica autodestruccion de EE.UU. y sus titeres surcoreanos."
