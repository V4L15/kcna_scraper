Minju Joson says this in a commentary today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The news analyst goes on:\r\n   It is needless to say that the Japanese reactionaries' allegation that the north's launch of an artificial satellite was a \"missile launch\" stems from their intention to justify their moves for a military giant and overseas expansion.\r\n   Their  reckless moves are a substantial threat and challenge to peace and security in Korea and Asia.\r\n   Japan is trying to get something in relations with us through share of funds for the light water reactors, which is inviting criticism and ridicule as a political ignoramus, not knowing the essence and principle of things.    If the Japanese reactionaries resort to the anti-DPRK moves, joining hands with the hostile forces, they will get nothing but the most catastrophic consequences.    \r\n\r\n"

Choe Chang Dong (former professor of law at Pusan College of Foreign Studies) was infiltrated into Pomminryon for the purposes of disintegration and destruction of the organisation.\r\n   Choe stole some of computer files of Kim Kyong Phil and transferred them to the ANSP.\r\n   Han Yong Su, an agent of the ANSP, kidnapped the couple on January 13 with the document as a bait.\r\n   The Chosun Ilbo Newspaper of South Korea January 17 spread a rumour about the North Korean diplomat's \"defection to America.\" the next day, other mass media of South Korea reported that Kim Kyong Phil asked the U.S. consulate for \"asylum.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On January 20, South Korean media quoted a government official as saying that Kim might seek \"asylum\" in a third country, not the United States. The press reports were incoherent because the incident was not \"asylum\" but abduction.\r\n   We strongly warn the South Korean government and the ANSP, if you do not return the innocent couple, we will inform the world public and conscientious-minded people of this fact, and the Kim Dae Jung regime of South Korea will be branded by the international community as a terrorist regime. The incident will be described as a second kidnapping of Tong Paek Rim, and you will be to blame for the consequence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean regime must immediately release the couple and apologize for the criminal act.\r\n   We will indict the South Korean regime's international terrorism, informing the German public that this is a second Tong Paek Rim case.\r\n   The South Korean regime must give up despicable terrorism and kidnapping abroad at once.    \r\n\r\n"
