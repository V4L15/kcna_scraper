            "content": "Resolution on exalting President Kim Il Sung's life and feats forever\r\n Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- The Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and Central Military Commission and the DPRK National Defence Commission, Central People's Committee and Administration Council issued a resolution \"On exalting the great leader comrade Kim Il Sung's revolutionary life and immortal exploits for all ages.\"\r\n   The resolution dated July 8 reads in full:\r\n   It is three years since President Kim Il Sung passed away while making devoted activities for the people's freedom and happiness, the country's independence, sovereignty and prosperity and victory in socialism for more than eighty years.\r\n   On the occasion of this anniversary, all the Party members, People's Army officers and men and working people, who made a triumphant and glorious revolution and brought about epoch-making changes in their country under his wise leadership, are filled with deep reverence for their leader peerless in the history of five thousand years and are determined to exalt his revolutionary life and enduring feats for all ages.\r\n  Presiden Kim Il Sung is the founder of socialist Korea, a great revolutionary, a distinguished statesman and an invincible and determined commander who performed lasting revolutionary exploits with his brilliant wisdom, extraordinary leadership and noble virtues.\r\n   The shining victories won in Korea's history and the people's revolutionary movement in the 20th century are all directly linked with his name.\r\n   With a deep insight into the urgent demand of the time and the desire of the people, he founded the immortal Juche idea, a man-centred new philosophical idea, in his early years. This made a turning point in the history of human thought and a great contribution to its treasure-house and heralded the Juche era, a new era in history.\r\n   He clearly indicated the correctest path of the Korean revolution with the Juche idea, organised and victoriously led the unprecedentedly arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, achieved the cause of national liberation and established the glorious revolutionary traditions which serve as an eternal foundation for victorious advance of the Korean revolution.\r\n   He built a powerful revolutionary Party, Government and army of Juche type, laid a firm foundation for the building of a new country, triumphantly led our Party and people in the great Fatherland Liberation War against the invasion of U.S. imperialism, shouldering all burdens of war, and creditably safeguarded the country's freedom and independence.\r\n   He led the socialist revolution and construction to victory, pulling through an untrodden path and setting a brilliant example in the revolution and construction. This made a lasting revolutionary contribution to the history of the socialist movement, turned Korea, once a backward colony, into a sovereign and prospering socialist country which is famous for its strong sense of self-determination and national identity and for its independence in politics, self-sufficiency in the economy and self-reliance in national defence and made the once powerless and maltreated Korean nation an independent and dignified nation envied by people around the world.\r\n   Looking far into the distant future of the country and revolution, he laid a firm guarantee for our Party and people to inherit the blood of the Mt. Paektu-rooted Korean revolution pure and clean and accomplish the Juche revolution. This is the most precious of his revolutionary achievements.\r\n   Gifted with deep love for and trust in the people, he always mixed with the people and showed great care and favors for them in the whole course of his leadership over the revolution and construction. He granted our people the most precious political integrity and enabled them to lead a dignified and worthy life as independent humanity.\r\n   He defined the reunification of the country as the greatest task of the nation, indicated the correctest path to independent reunification of the country, wisely led the 70 million Koreans in the north, south and abroad to follow the path and opened a bright vista for reunification.\r\n   He is, indeed, the savior of national restoration and the great founder and leader of Juche Korea and the tender-hearted father of the people as he achieved the independence of Korea and the freedom and liberation of the Korean people, won brilliant victories in the revolutionary struggle and construction work and led the country and people to national prosperity and development. \r\n   As a recognised elder statesman of the world, he led the progressive people of the world under the motto of independence, peace and friendship and made immortal contributions to the cause of independence.\r\n   He is an eternal symbol of all victories of the Korean people. His immortal revolutionary idea and exploits are the most valuable heritage he bequeathed to our Party and people And eternal wealth that enables our people to pull through any storm and stress and complete the Juche revolution.\r\n   It is the firm determination of our Party and the unanimous will of all people to uphold him as their eternal leader and the sun of Juche for all ages, resolutely defend his revolutionary achievements and exalt them generation after generation.\r\n   Over the last three years since he passed away, our Party members, People's Army soldiers, workers and all other people, young and old, men and women, have mourned over his death with ardent longing and bitterest grief, changed the great sorrow into strength and courage, smashed the vicious moves of the imperialist reactionaries, resolutely safeguarded socialism and vigorously advanced their revolution. Our people have displayed their noblest morality and resolution to remain loyal to their leader forever and demonstrated their revolutionary faith and indomitable will to defend and complete his revolutionary cause under the leadership of the Party.\r\n   Our people firmly believe that he will always be with them. He will be immortal in our hearts, enjoying trust and reverence from all people as the founder of endlessly prospering socialist Korea and the eternal banner of victory in our revolution.\r\n   Today our Party and people have entered a new age in the Juche revolution when they will carry to completion the leader's revolutionary cause generation after generation. \r\n   The new age is a great and historic age when decisive victory will be won in the Juche revolution, Korea will become a strong and rich country of Juche and the might and stamina of the reunified Korean nation will be displayed to the full.\r\n   On the occasion of the third death anniversary of President Kim Il Sung, the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and Central Military Commission and the DPRK National Defence Commission, Central People's Committee and Administration Council, reflecting the unanimous desire of all the Party members, People's Army soldiers and people to exalt his revolutionary life and immortal feats and complete his cause under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, decide as follows:\r\n   The revolutionary life and achievements of President Kim Il Sung shall be exalted along with the eternal history of Juche Korea.\r\n   1. The Juche calendar shall be instituted with 1912, when President Kim Il Sung was born as the sun of Juche, as the first year.\r\n   2. His birthday April 15, the greatest national holiday, shall be defined as the Day of the Sun.\r\n   The Worker's Party of Korea Central Committee and Central Military Commission and the DPRK National Defence Commission, Central People's Committee and Administration Council firmly believe that all the Party members, People's Army soldiers and people will achieve greater victory in the efforts to exalt President Kim Il Sung's revolutionary life and immortal feats for all ages and carry forward his revolutionary cause under the tested leadership of the Party.\r\n\r\n"
