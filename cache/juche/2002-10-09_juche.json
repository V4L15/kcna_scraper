Over the past 57 years the WPK has successfully led the revolution and construction without any mistake or deviation in shaping policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the country's liberation in 1945, the WPK set up the Juche-oriented people's government on the basis of the experience gained in building power organs during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. In reliance on the government based on the worker-peasant alliance and dependent on the united front of the popular masses, it has successfully discharged its historic mission of realizing the independence of the popular masses in the long period of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK enforced the agrarian reform, nationalization of major industries and other democratic reforms and successfully completed the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal democratic revolutionary tasks in a short span of time following its foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the Korean revolution entered a new stage of its development in 1955, the WPK set forth the line to accelerate socialist revolution in real earnest and encouraged the people to turn out in the struggle for its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of the old production relations (private businesses) successfully carried out within 4 or 5 years, the advantageous socialist system was established on this land and the popular masses were liberated from the exploitation and oppression once and for all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK defined the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, as main tasks of revolution to be fulfilled in the socialist society and provided a firm guarantee for moving up the complete victory of socialism by pushing ahead with the revolutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years, it, under Kim Jong Il's army-based revolutionary leadership, has smashed the enemies' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and overcome severe economic difficulties, defending the sovereignty and dignity of the country and fully demonstrating the might of ideological and military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean people entrust their future and destiny fully to the WPK, the banner of all victory and glory.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
