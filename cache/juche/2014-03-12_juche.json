But, the U.S. renders the situation tense with such port-call of warships, in a bid to check the improvement of north-south relations, get on the DPRK's nerves militarily and then destroy the stability in the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such being the fact, the U.S. and its followers have pulled up the DPRK over its regular rocket launching drills for bolstering the self-defensive military muscle, branding them as a \"provocation\" intended to \"key up\" the situation in and around the peninsula. This is a deceptive trick to cover their true colors as a wrecker of peace and stability in the peninsula and divert the attention of the world public to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. openly launched the joint military exercises against the DPRK and even introduced such strategic strike means for preemptive attack as nuclear submarine. So, it is the height of impudence for the U.S. to make noise about the DPRK's regular rocket launching drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the U.S. regarding the Korean Peninsula as a springboard for realizing its Asia-Pacific strategy dislikes any good results to be made by the DPRK's efforts for improved north-south relations and national reconciliation and unity. The real intention of the U.S. is to spoil the atmosphere for improved north-south relations, a hindrance to the realization of its strategy by getting on the DPRK's nerves to the full to invite military countermeasures from it and then launching anti-DPRK smear campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way the U.S. seeks to cover up its colors as an aggressor swimming against the world trend toward peace and detente and shift the blame for aggravated regional situation on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anyhow, nothing can cover up the U.S. nature as an aggressor posing constant danger of a nuclear war to the Korean Peninsula in disregard of its peoples' demand, and blocks the reunification of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. takes no account of the destiny and existence of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans should turn out in the struggle to foil the U.S. moves for aggression on the DPRK, rejecting its policy of national estrangement."
