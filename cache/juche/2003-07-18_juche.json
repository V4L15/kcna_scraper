Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- The South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification reportedly issued a statement on July 11 accusing the South Korean Grand National Party of calling for a \"new law on special inspection\" in a bid to incite south-north confrontation. it demanded its disbandment.\r\n The statement said that when the investigation under the \"law on special inspection of the remittance to the north\" was suspended the GNP has become extremely desperate in its unreasonable moves to push the south-north relations to overall confrontation through a new investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious in the \"new law on special inspection\" called for by the party is that it tried to link the \"remittance to the north\" with the \"nuclear issue of the north,\" the statement noted, adding that this is an anti-reunification act going against the spirit of the June 15 Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement demanded the GNP disorganize itself as it is following the U.S. war strategy against the north while ignoring the ardent desire of all people in the struggle to achieve independence and peace through national cooperation.    \r\n"

            "content": "KCNA refutes Japanese heavyweight's ultra-nationalist remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) --Dietman from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan Eto, an ultra-right reactionary element, again let loose reckless remarks, inviting criticism of the public at home and abroad and touching off indignation of the Asians.\r\n On July 12 he at a branch regular meeting of the LDP defended the Japanese imperialists' invasion of Asia and the monstrous murders committed by them in China and other places. As if it were not enough with this he, referring to Japan's military occupation of Korea, asserted that both countries signed a pact and the UN unconditionally supported it, stunning the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a common sense that there existed no un in the period of the Japanese imperialists' military occupation of Korea and it is a stark historical fact that the Japanese imperialists committed bloody massacres wherever they set their feet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Historical facts can be neither denied nor falsified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Eto, who has been elected member of the house of representatives from the LDP for the last ten consecutive terms, once held the post of the director general of the agency of management and coordination. If he lacks such a common sense, it is clear that the Japanese politicians are all philistines with low i.q. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that he is behaving like a schizophrenic patient, unbecoming for his status as a veteran dietman from the LDP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His wild remarks not only betray the sophism of a demented person but reflect Japan's political tendency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are putting forward such fanatic ultra-nationalists as Eto and Ishihara to justify Japan's military occupation rule over Korea in a bid to flee from its responsibility for evading the redeem of its past and rapidly militarize the Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is eloquently proved by what Fukuda, chief cabinet secretary of Japan, told journalists on July 14 soon after Eto's remarks. He said that \"the government is not in a position to comment on the remarks made by a dietman.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At such tacit connivance of the authorities the Japanese ultra-nationalists are making provocative remarks one after another in a bid to create an atmosphere of turning the Japanese society to the right and pushing forward in real earnest their moves for militarization and fascism to launch reinvasion of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to bear in mind that such moves will only lead Japan to a final ruin.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Militarist maniac's outbursts blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- Takami Eto, member of the House of Representatives from the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, at a \"branch regular meeting\" let loose outbursts distorting the history in a bid to justify the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea. This comes under fire by papers here today.\r\n This clearly proves that the true colors and wild dream of the militarist maniacs remain unchanged despite the flow of time, they say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary says that the \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" mentioned by him was a \"treaty\" forced by the Japanese imperialists upon Korea in 1910 as they occupied her by force of arms and, moreover, the united nations did not exist at that time. \r\n The aim sought by the Japanese right-wing reactionaries through the distortion of the history of aggression and war is to imbue the Japanese people with the militarist idea to repeat its blood-stained history, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Eto made so far-fetched assertion as to insist that the Japanese imperialists' military occupation of Korea was \"legal\" as it was \"unconditionally recognized by the un.\" such shameless distortion of history, in essence, means a total denial of aggression and crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Eto is a die-hard ultra-right reactionary steeped in the militarist idea to the marrow of his bone. What he uttered, therefore, fully reflects the militarist wild dream of the Japanese reactionary forces keen on the distortion of history and reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Eto's remarks can not but pose a serious problem as they came at a time when the Japanese reactionaries are openly advocating a \"hard-line measure\", \"pressure\" and \"preemptive attack\" and putting spurs to their moves for the reinvasion of Korea, while escalating their steps to become a military power and rushing headlong into overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
