If it is to be free from the tragedy as early as possible, there should be a change in South Korea.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today says this in an article titled \"Policy switchover in South Korea is actual demand.\"\r\n   Though nearly two months has passed since the change of regime in South Korea, there has been no sign of affirmative change there, the daily says.\r\n   It accuses the present rulers of South Korea of pursuing treacherous, separatist, confrontation and war moves little different from those of the \"civilian\" dictators.      They are opposing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, refusing to eliminate the \"National Security Law\" and the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" and escalating the confrontation and war moves against the north, it says, and continues:\r\n   The fact makes us suspect that they will follow in their predecessors' footsteps, characterized by anti-independence, anti-nation, anti-reunification and anti-north policies.\r\n   They should break with the past in keeping with the South Korean people's demand for the replacement of the anti-north war moves with a pro-north reconciliation policy.    They should also take a patriotic stand of national independence, join hands with the fellow countrymen in the north and shape the destiny of the country and the nation with concerted efforts.    \r\n\r\n"
