The \"threat from the north\" advertised by the U.S. bellicose elements to justify the U.S. military presence in South Korea is a sheer lie and fabrication. It is designed to describe the U.S. imperialist aggression forces as the \"war deterrent force\" and a \"guardian of peace\" in a bid to perpetuate their permanent military presence in South Korea and, furthermore, dominate the whole of Korea and northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean anti-reunification elements label the people in the northern half of Korea as the \"principal enemy\" and make desperate efforts to unleash a war against the north, calling for \"cooperation\" with outsiders on the plea of what they call \"security.\" It is a tragedy and a disgrace to the Korean people to allow them to remain as part of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fratricidal showdown and war lead to self-destruction because they only give a chance to outsiders to fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people who call for the independent reunification of the country should not allow this land, their cradle, to be turned into shambles of a fratricidal war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The existence of the \"security law\" is very anachronistic as it is a chief obstacle to national concord and reunification at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will work hard to foil any attempt to hamstring the reunification movement and remain true to the idea \"by the united efforts of the Korean people\".    \r\n\r\n"
