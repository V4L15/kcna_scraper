Then units supporting the advancing forces conducted combat actions to destroy different kinds of obstacles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Helicopters\" which had flown to check the advance of mechanized units were destroyed to pieces by precision strikes of shoulder-fired rockets and various type self-propelled artillery pieces of Combined Unit 478 of the KPA blew up targets by volley firing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the drill was over, Kim Jong Un analyzed the merits and demerits in the drill and set forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for developing the KPA into the invincible revolutionary armed forces by intensifying the training just as the anti-Japanese guerillas did in Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the drill staged this time is of weighty significance in implementing the party's military and strategic policy, he instructed the KPA to frequently organize such drill as the commanding officers and staff officers have to use their brains a lot when similar actual drills are staged between the two sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, and O Il Jong, department director of the C.C., the WPK."

            "content": "Criminal Nature of Anti-DPRK Leaflet-Scattering Operations of U.S., S. Korea Laid Bare \r\n Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute released a white paper Friday exposing the criminal nature of the leaflet-scattering operations which the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces stage by instigating human scum.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are to blame for such a deplorable situation as today as they have escalated confrontation on the Korean peninsula and gave rise to the leaflet issue that has increased the danger of a war, the white paper says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Korean war in the past the U.S. formed psychological warfare units under the Command of the U.S. forces in the Far East and the Command of the 8th army and let them scatter anti-DPRK leaflets in different parts of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anti-DPRK leaflets scattered by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in January 1952 alone numbered over 150 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of anti-DPRK leaflets scattered by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces during the three-year war stood at more than 2 460 million, according to an official report and it reached a total of over 4 000 million if the number of those scattered by the south Korean puppet forces is added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces have become all the more undisguised in their leaflet-scattering operation after the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the instigation of the U.S., the south Korean puppet forces organized many psychological warfare units in charge of scattering leaflets among forefront units and in the 1970s they conducted \"leaflet balloon operation\" for sending leaflets deeper into the rear of the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even after the publication of the historic July 4 joint statement in 1972, the puppet forces did not stop the leaflet-scattering operation, in violation of the agreement on refraining from acts of slandering the other side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering the 1980s, the south Korean puppet forces set up a unit for psychological warfare and leaflet-scattering under the army and in 1991 they reorganized the unit to put it directly under the Defense Ministry and set up a system for unified command of the anti-DPRK leaflet-scattering operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to data on \"psychological warfare toward the north\" which was presented to \"National Assembly\" by the puppet Defense Ministry in 2011, the number of leaflets scattered in the areas of the DPRK from the 1980s to the end of the 1990s was more than 1 918 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities could not directly take part in the operation after the adoption and publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration as an agreement was reached between the military authorities of the north and the south to stop all psychological warfare including leaflet-scattering operation and to end all other hostile acts. So they have resorted to crafty method of prodding the \"defectors from the north\", human scum, and ultra-right conservative organizations into the operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In October 2003, Ri Min Bok took part in scattering leaflets under the mask of the representative of the Association of North Korean Christians. Plot-breeding organizations made up of human scum such as the Headquarters for the Movement for Democratic North, the Alliance for the Movement of Free North, the General Association of Organizations of Defectors from the North and the Association for Promotion of Democracy in the North made their appearances and buckled down to leaflet-scattering operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The operation has become all the more undisguised during the Lee Myung Bak regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group nullified all the north-south agreements on ending all hostile acts including mud-slinging and made leaflet-scattering a priority task in realizing its \"policy toward the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet army resumed anti-DPRK psychological warfare including broadcasting and leaflet-scattering operation. Equipment for releasing more than 80 000 sheets of leaflets a day was developed to be deployed in the forefront units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An official concerned of the puppet army said at that time that \"there were more than 1 300 kinds of original copies of leaflets and over 470 kinds of broadcasting scripts for psychological warfare against the north during war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group brought more than 20 wicked deserters including Hong Sun Gyong, chairman of the Committee for Democracy of the North, An Chan Il, president of the World Federation of North Koreans and Kim Hung Gwang, representative of the Solidarity of NK Intellectuals and Pak Sang Hak, representative of the Alliance for the Movement of Free North, to Chongwadae in January 2011 and promised them aid fund for leaflet-scattering while wining and dining them. The puppet forces have massively funded human scum in their leaflet-scattering operation after earmarking more than 100 million U.S. dollars for supporting \"defectors from the north\" every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The budget allocated for leaflet-scattering operations amounted to 200 000 U.S. dollars from 2011 to July 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the present regime, the anti-DPRK leaflet-scattering operation has become all the more undisguised to put the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors into the shade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of south Korea sent a congratulatory message to the Association for Promotion of Democracy in the North comprising wicked deserters who took the lead in scattering anti-DPRK leaflets in October 2012 even before taking office as \"president\" only to be denounced by the public. After taking office, she invited to Chongwadae and encouraged human scum who had worked with bloodshot eyes for leaflet-scattering.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She even posted human scum of anti-DPRK plot-breeding organizations such as the Committee for Democracy of the North, the Solidarity of NK Intellectuals and the Center for Strategy toward the North to the \"Committee for Great Unity of People\" and the \"Committee for Preparations for Unification\" which are directly under the \"president\", prodding them into action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces even developed a satellite air navigation device to be mounted on balloons for scattering leaflets, a program for controlling balloons to suit the wind direction and speed and the technology of radio transmission system for sending e-leaflets into the rear of the DPRK side, and have provided them free to human scum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though they agreed to stop slandering the other side at the first round of the north-south high-level contact in February, the conservative puppet forces have continued scattering leaflets. They even mull developing and deploying new leaflet-scattering shell to be fired from K-9 self-propelled gun in order to send leaflets farther into the rear of the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. actively supports the operation, openly saying that such psychological warfare as leaflet-scattering is an effective means for disintegrating and overthrowing the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the spirit of reconciliation and reunification mounted between the north and the south after the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration, the U.S. organized together with the puppet forces the \"combined command for psychological warfare\" and introduced EC-130 special plane known as a \"flying broadcasting station\" and a unit specializing in psychological warfare as part of its stepped-up anti-DPRK psychological warfare. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. also instituted the \"Act on Free North\" aimed at \"regime change\" and let \"defectors from the north\" take the lead in conducting smear campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In April 2006 and September 2008 the then U.S. President Bush met Kim Song Min and Pak Sang Hak who are representatives of the Radio Free North Korea and the Alliance for the Movement of Free North and egged them on to leaflet-scattering operation while praising them as \"outpost soldiers for expansion of freedom\". In February this year the U.S. invited Pak Sang Hak and Kang Chol Hwan, representative of the Center for Strategy toward the North, to the Silicon Valley and showed them technology for disseminating USB, DVD and other media to the area of the DPRK side through GPS.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In July it staged a contest of information and telecommunications technology for breaking through the information network of the north in a worldwide scale with the attendance of the defectors and handed over to them ultra-modern development data for conducting anti-DPRK smear psychological campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. even stipulated in the OPLAN 5029 an article calling for making the north collapse by changing the understanding of the north Korean citizens through NGOs. To this end, it has financed organizations made up of \"defectors from the north\" through its NGOs like the State Democratic Fund, Alliance for Free North and Human Rights Watch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The State Democratic Fund whose mission is to overthrow the governments of anti-U.S. states has increasingly funded organizations made up of \"defectors from the north\": 1.21 million U.S. dollars in 2007, 1.27 million U.S. dollars in 2008, 1.4 million U.S. dollars in 2009 and 1.45 million U.S. dollars in 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. State Department has also funded the Network for Democratic North, Radio for Free North Korea, Solidarity of Women Defectors from North for Rights, etc. more than one million U.S. dollars each year starting from 2009.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By spending over 20 million U.S. dollars for human scum each year, the U.S. instigated them to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, its social system and human rights not only in south Korea and the U.S. but also on the UN arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"defectors from the north\" who joined all sorts of plot-breeding organizations such as the Headquarters for Movement for Democratic North, the Alliance for the Movement of Free North, the Association of North Korean Christians scatter more than 10 million leaflets on a yearly average.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The defectors whom the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces instigate to anti-DPRK campaign by painting them as \"human rights fighters\" are group of criminals and betes noires who should not be left intact in society in the light of law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So great is the catastrophic impact the anti-DPRK leaflet-scattering operation has on the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK smear campaign conducted by the vicious \"defectors from the north\" under the patronage and manipulation of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities are a serious act of provoking a war as it is in violation of the Armistice Agreement and the north-south agreements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should feel ashamed of the fact that the dollar symbolic of its sovereignty is being misused for smear campaign by human scum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities should immediately stop leaflet-scattering operations, clearly understanding the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their anti-DPRK plot-breeding racket."

The projected forum is part of the initiative.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The initiative is unanimously censured and condemned by the public at home and abroad as the south Korean regime seeks \"unification through absorption under liberal democracy\" by playing the role of an advance party and shock brigade in carrying out the U.S. hostile policy to disarm the dignified DPRK and bring down its socialist system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 21st century the world strategic pivot is being shifted to Asia-Pacific and, accordingly, the military strategic pivot is being transferred to Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. made a policy switchover from Europe to Asia-Pacific. It is intensifying its political, economic and military intervention in Asia-Pacific, advocating the theory of a Pacific state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the U.S. is beefing up its forces as required by its new regional strategy and pivot strategy and taking frequent military actions to secure an unchallenged military edge in this region, while keeping the Cold War mechanism there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most acute hostile relations exist between the DPRK and U.S. in Northeast Asia at present. A touch-and-go situation prevails there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK remains unchanged though the bosses of the White House were replaced often from Truman, the architect of the Korean division, to Obama.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK has been amended and supplemented with harsher contents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. policy to stifle and isolate the DPRK politically, economically and militarily and its actions have reached a more dangerous phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves stepped up by the U.S. to tighten sanctions and isolate and blockade the DPRK and escalate its military threats against the DPRK   over its nuclear deterrence are driving the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war. The \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK has gone beyond the danger line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is systemically beefing up its forces in Northeast Asia in a bid to ignite another Korean war while reducing forces in other regions of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK is the harshest policy to bring down the ideology and social system with American-style democracy and market economy and swallow up the whole nation and land of Korea by force of arms through aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. labeled the DPRK \"provoker and dangerous entity\" to attain this policy goal and is busy escalating the \"sanctions, isolation and blockade\" against the DPRK by whipping together undesirable forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue on the peninsula remains unsettled, situation deteriorates periodically and tension escalates due to the DPRK-U.S. hostile relations, source of mistrust and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The termination of DPRK-U.S. hostile relations is the most urgent for ensuring peace in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has worked hard for peace, proceeding from the requirements of its domestic and foreign policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is dearer to us than a peaceful environment and tension is harmful to us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., south Korea and other anti-DPRK forces claim that the situation on the peninsula remains tense due to the DPRK's nukes but it was none other than the U.S. which compelled the DPRK to have access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's decision to have access to nuclear deterrence was an inevitable one, unable to live any longer in face of the U.S. hostile policy, military pressure and nuclear blackmail over half a century since its foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nukes serve as a means of deterring a war. The DPRK didn't have access to them to harm or threaten someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The acute situation on the peninsula created due to the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK is like a time-bomb posing constant threat to the peace and security in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out on the peninsula, it will cause a chain reaction and develop into a regional war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is the most urgent for ensuring security in Northeast Asia is to settle the hostile relations between the DPRK and U.S. and defuse the military confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There would be no regional peace and cooperation without doing this."

Y en la decada de 1970, cometieron hasta la \"operacion de globos que transportan volantes\" para lanzarlos a las zonas mas profundas de la retaguardia de la parte norcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de publicada la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 4 de Julio en 1972, no dejaron de lanzar los volantes violando el acuerdo sobre el cese de calumnias reciprocas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la decada de 1980, instituyeron el nuevo destacamento de volantes para la guerra psicologica, subordinado a las fuerzas terrestres, y en 1991, lo ampliaron como \"unidad del ejercito nacional\" adscrito directamente al Ministerio de Defensa Nacional, de modo que se estableciera el sistema de mando unificado sobre el lanzamiento de volantes anti-RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun los datos sobre la \"situacion actual de la guerra psicologica anti-Norte\", presentado en 2011 a la \"Asamblea Nacional\" por el Ministerio de Defensa Nacional, el circulo militar surcoreano envio a la parte norcoreana mas de mil 918 millones de volantes desde la decada de 1980 hasta finales de la decada de 1990.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de aprobada la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, las autoridades militares de ambas partes acordaron parar todas las formas de guerra psicologicas incluso el lanzamiento de volantes y los actos hostiles. Entonces, impotentes de hacerlo directamente, los titeres surcoreanos instigaron a lanzar volantes a los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\" y las entidades conservadoras y ultraderechistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn octubre de 2003, Ri Min Bok, disfrazado de representante de la \"Asociacion de Cristianos Norcoreanos\", cometio el lanzamiento de volantes anti-RPDC. Se sumaron luego al lanzamiento otras numerosas entidades como la \"Direccion del Movimiento para la Democratizacion del Norte de Corea\", la \"Federacion de Movimiento por el Norte Libre\", la \"Federacion General de Entidades de Fugitivos Norcoreanos\", la \"Asociacion de Promocion de Democratizacion del Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta campana se torno mas febril en el periodo de mandato del traidor Lee Myung Bak. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Lee invalido los acuerdos Norte-Sur de parar los actos hostiles incluso las calumnias reciprocas y presento el lanzamiento de volantes como tarea principal de la \"politica sobre el Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, se reiniciaron la radiodifusion del ejercito titere surcoreano, el lanzamiento de volantes y otras formas de guerra psicologica anti-RPDC. Y se distribuyeron a las unidades en la primera linea del frente los equipos capaces de imprimir mas de 80 mil volantes al dia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn funcionario del ejercito surcoreano de aquel entonces confeso que \"para la campana psicologica anti-RPDC en el tiempo de guerra tenemos archivados los manuscritos de volantes de mas de mil 300 generos y los de radiodifusion de mas de 470 generos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn enero de 2011, la banda de Lee Myung Bak organizo en Chongwadae una orgia con mas de 20 fugitivos norcoreanos connotados, entre otros, el presidente del \"Comite para la Democratizacion del Norte\", Hong Sun Gyong, el presidente de la \"Federacion General Mundial de Norcoreanos\", An Chan Il, el representante de la \"Solidaridad de Intelectuales NK\", Kim Hung Gwang, y el representante de la \"Federacion de Movimiento por el Norte Libre\", Pak Sang Hak, y les prometio financiar el lanzamiento de volantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, por el concepto de ayuda a los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\", asigno anualmente mas de 100 millones de US$. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde 2011 hasta julio de 2012, las autoridades surcoreanas entregaron 200 mil US$ del presupuesto para financiar el lanzamiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el actual \"poder\" surcoreano, se torna mas brutal la campana de lanzamiento de volantes anti-RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa antes de su toma de posesion, en octubre de 2012, la mandataria surcoreana fue repudiada por la opinion publica por haber enviado el \"mensaje de felicitacion\" a la ceremonia de constitucion de la \"Federacion por la Promocion de Democratizacion del Norte de Corea\" integrada por los fugitivos norcoreanos que estaban al frente del lanzamiento de volantes anti-RPDC. Y despues de ser inquilina de Chongwadae, invito y estimulo a esas escorias humanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas incorporo al \"Comite de Gran Unidad del Pueblo\" y al \"Comite Preparatorio para la Unificacion\", aparatos adscritos a la \"presidenta\", a las escorias humanas del \"Comite para la Democratizacion del Norte\", la \"Solidaridad de Intelectuales NK\", el \"Centro de Estrategia sobre el Norte\" y otras entidades intrigantes anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La banda surcoreana les ofrece gratuitamente el aparato de navegacion por satelite a ser instalado en el globo de transporte de volantes, el programa que lo controla segun la direccion y velocidad del viento, y la tecnica capaz de transmitir los volantes electronicos hasta a la retaguardia de la parte norcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque se acordo prohibir la censura a la contraparte en el primer contacto de alto nivel Norte-Sur efectuado en febrero, la horda conservadora surcoreana continuo el lanzamiento de volantes y pretende desarrollar y desplegar hasta el proyectil de lanzamiento de volantes de nuevo tipo para el canon autopropulsado K-9 con el fin de enviarlos mas lejos de la retaguardia norcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. apoyo activamente el envio de volantes diciendo abiertamente que la campana psicologica como ese es el medio eficiente para desestabilizar y derrocar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Especialmente, cuando se elevaba el ambiente de reconciliacion y reunificacion entre el Norte y el Sur despues del 15 de junio de 2000, fabrico la \"comandancia combinada de la guerra psicologica\" junto con el ejercito surcoreano y recurrio a la campana psicologica anti-RPDC introduciendo hasta el avion especial EC-130, llamado como \"estacion radioemisora voladora\", y la unidad de guerra psicologica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, invento la \"ley de libertad del Norte\" con el objetivo del \"cambio del regimen\" de la RPDC y pone a los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\" al frente de la campana intrigante contra ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En abril de 2006 y en septiembre de 2008, el entonces presidente norteamericano Bush invito a EE.UU. a Kim Song Min, Pak Sang Hak y otras escorias humanas nombrados como representantes de las entidades intrigantes como la \"Radio del Norte Libre\" y la \"Federacion de Movimiento por el Norte Libre\" y los instigo al lanzamiento de volantes anti-RPDC elogiando que ellos son \"vanguardias en la expansion de libertad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En febrero de este ano, EE.UU. invito a Pak Sang Hak, Kang Chol Hwan, representante del \"Centro de Estrategia sobre el Norte\", y otros tipejos y les permitio visitar Silicon Valley para demostrarles la tecnica de enviar USB, DVD y otros medios electronicos a las zonas de la RPDC usando GPS.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Bajo la participacion de los fugitivos norcoreanos, organizo en escala internacional la \"exposicion de tecnica de informaciones y comunicaciones para romper la red de informatica norcoreana\" y les entrego en esa ocasion los datos de desarrollo de tecnicas de punta para la campana psicologica anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Especialmente, anoto en OPLAN 5029 el parrafo de \"derrocar al Norte de Corea al cambiar la concepcion de los habitantes norcoreanos a traves de las organizaciones no gubernamentales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para ponerlo en practica, ofrece cada ano enormes fondos a las entidades de los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\", que se dedican al lanzamiento, por conducto del Fondo Democratico Estatal, la Alianza por el Norte Libre, Human Rights Watch y otras organizaciones y entidades norteamericanas no gubernamentales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"Fondo Democratico Estatal\", que se dedica al derrocamiento del regimen de los Estados antiyanquis, aumenta cada ano el fondo de ayuda a las entidades de \"fugitivos norcoreanos\": un millon 210 mil US$ en 2007, un millon 270 mil US$ en 2008, un millon 400 mil US$ en 2009 y un millon 450 mil US$ en 2010 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. entrega todos los anos desde 2009 mas de un millon de US$ a las entidades como \"Network por el Norte Democratico\", \"Radio para el Libre Norte de Corea\" y la \"Solidaridad de Norcoreanas Fugitivas para los DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi EE.UU. proporciona cada ano a las escorias humanas mas de 20 millones de US$ y las instiga a calumniar y tergiversar en el Sur de Corea, EE.UU. y los escenarios de la ONU la maxima dignidad, el regimen y el estado de DDHH de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsimismo, los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\" de la \"Direccion del Movimiento para la Democratizacion del Norte de Corea\", la \"Federacion de Movimiento por el Norte Libre\", la \"Asociacion de Cristianos Norcoreanos\" y otras entidades intrigantes enviaron a la parte norcoreana mas de 10 millones de volantes como promedio anual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos \"fugitivos norcoreanos\", que EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos describen como \"luchadores por los DDHH\", son la horda de criminales y basuras humanas que deben ser sancionados por la ley y por la sociedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon incontables las consecuencias catastroficas que produjo el lanzamiento de volantes de contenido anti-RPDC en las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa campana anti-RPDC de los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\", que se lanza bajo el amparo y el control de EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas, es un acto en busca de guerra que viola el Acuerdo de Armisticio y los acuerdos Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe sentirse avergonzado por el uso del dolar, que simboliza su poder, en los complots de esa chusma.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades titeres surcoreanas deben poner de inmediato fin al lanzamiento de volantes contra la RPDC teniendo presente sus consecuencias catastroficas."
