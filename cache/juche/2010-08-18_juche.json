The all-round joint military exercises being staged across south Korea in the wake of the provocative war maneuvers in the East and West Seas of Korea in less than one month are the dangerous military provocations to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These war maneuvers are a wanton violation of the Armistice Agreement and diametrically run counter to the presidential statement of the UNSC dated July 9, 2010 which calls for settling the pending issues on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations in a peaceful manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such ceaseless military provocations being perpetrated in utter disregard of the concern of the international community about the tensions running high in the Korean Peninsula and the region go to clearly prove that the U.S. is, indeed, the arch criminal threatening and wrecking the global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers are so reckless as to dig their own graves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is ready both for dialogue and war and has all means and methods to defend itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation makes the DPRK more keenly feel the validity and vitality of the Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should understand that there is a critical point in the tension, too, and should not calculate they can evade the blame for the explosive situation."

Seguidamente, despliegan ahora en toda la extension geografica surcoreana el citado ejercicio militar combinado, lo cual significa la peligrosisima provocacion militar encaminada a desatar, cueste lo que cueste, la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstas maniobras militares devienen flagrante violacion del Acuerdo de Armisticio y acto totalmente contrariado a la declaracion presidencial del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU fechada el 9 de julio de 2010 que demanda solucionar por via pacifica los problemas pendientes de la Peninsula Coreana mediante el dialogo y las negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas provocaciones militares, que se cometen sucesivamente despreciando totalmente la preocupacion de la sociedad internacional por la agravacion de la tension en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno, comprueban fehacientemente que EE.UU. es el que amenaza y destruye la paz y la seguridad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos maniacos de guerra estan cavando imprudentemente sus propias tumbas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos preparados tanto para el dialogo como para la guerra y disponemos de todos los medios y metodos para defender lo nuestro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion actual nos hace sentir en carne propia la justeza y la vigencia de la politica de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben saber que la agravacion de la tension tambien tiene su limite y abandonar las pretensiones de eludir la responsabilidad de la explosion de la situacion."

            "content": "CNCDP denuncia ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC en Sur de Corea \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 18 de agosto (ATCC) -- El portavoz del Comite Nacional Coreano por la Defensa de la Paz (CNCDP) hizo publica el dia 18 una declaracion para denunciar a Estados Unidos y la banda de titeres surcoreanos que iniciaron por fin el ejercicio militar conjunto \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" de caracter provocativo pese a la unanime condena y rechazo de toda la nacion coreana y los demas pueblos del mundo amantes de la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el presente simulacro, que se desarrolla a partir del dia 16 hasta el 26 de agosto, se movilizan mas de 30 mil efectivos norteamericanos, tres veces mayor que en los tiempos anteriores, mas de 56 mil uniformados del ejercito titere surcoreano y mas de 400 mil civiles de mas de 4 mil organos, incluso las entidades autonomas centrales y locales, revela la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y la banda de titeres surcoreanos ya habian desarrollado en los Mares Este y Oeste de Corea los ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC bajo el pretexto del incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana. Seguidamente, despliegan freneticamente en toda la extension surcoreana el simulacro conjunto \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\", lo cual demuestra cuan enloquecidos estan ellos por desatar la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente simulacro es el ensayo de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC, que se realiza segun el plan de operacion de ataque preventivo contra esta movilizando muchos equipos modernos de guerra y efectivos y combinando el tiro y el traslado en el clima de combate de verdad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los titeres surcoreanos lo describen con palabras ridiculas como \"para disuadir la guerra y preservar la paz\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una sofisteria hablar de la \"paz\" y de la \"prevencion de la guerra\" justamente cuando los titeres surcoreanos convirtieron todo el territorio surcoreano en el espacio de tiroteos y canonazos para atacar a los connacionales en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnsenaremos claramente a los belicistas que con ese ejercicio militar anti-RPDC, no van a ganar nada mas que la autodestruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no observaran nunca con brazos cruzados las provocaciones militares y las maniobras de guerra de los belicistas,  y como han declarado ya, daran un terrible golpe al baluarte de los enemigos en el cualquier momento y lugar imprevisibles."

            "content": "CRPP refuta discurso de Lee Myung Bak pronunciado por 15 de agosto\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 18 de agosto (ATCC) -- En relacion con que en su llamado \"discurso conmemorativo del 15 de agosto\" (dia de liberacion de Corea), el traidor Lee Myung Bak dijo unos chismes conflictivos y anti-reunificacion acusando a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) dio el dia 17 a la ATCC la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tNo cabe duda de que el \"impuesto de la reunificacion\" mencionado esta vez por el traidor Lee es un termino sumamente malsano que supone el \"estado de emergencia del Norte\" con que suenan absurda y vanamente los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos chismes conflictivos y anti-reunificacion de Lee revelan su intencion de eludir la responsabilidad de haber llevado al estado caotico las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas y perseguir de continuo la infame politica de confrontacion consistente en la \"desnuclearizacion, apertura y 3 000 dolares\", siendo el sofisma antinacional que lleva al extremo la ya aguda situacion actual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de titeres pronuncio esta vez unas palabras tan cinicas y repugnantes, tales como la \"reunificacion pacifica\" y la \"comunidad\" librando fanaticamente por otra parte en contubernio con EE.UU. el \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" y otros macro-ejercicios de guerra de agresion contra la RPDC. Por eso, tales palabras no pasan de ser un truco torpe para ocultar el atributo belicoso de ellos y enganar la opinion publica interna y externa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, el traidor Lee abogo por el \"cambio del Norte\" vinculando con la RPDC el ya desgastado caso de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana. Esto deviene una insoportable provocacion a la RPDC y la expresion de la siniestra intencion de la horda de traidores surcoreanos de perseguir hasta el final el enfrentamiento y la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs ridiculizado dentro y fuera del pais el \"impuesto de la reunificacion\" planteado por el traidor Lee justamente cuando la situacion esta tan tirante que puede dar lugar a la guerra hoy o manana. Es que esa palabra la puede decir solo el politico imbecil, que no sabe como marcha el mundo ni que es la reunificacion debido a su ignorancia de las relaciones intercoreanas, y el especulador que piensa que se resuelve lo todo con el dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs totalmente absurda tambien la palabra \"comunidad\" porque la camarilla surcoreana habla de la \"comunidad en paz\" librando casi todos los dias los ejercicios de guerra contra la RPDC, aboga por la \"comunidad economica\" sofocando los proyectos de cooperacion N-S y demanda la \"comunidad nacional\" negando las declaraciones conjuntas Norte-Sur e impidiendo la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla presenta la \"renuncia nuclear\" de alguien como premisa de las relaciones Norte-Sur y la reunificacion en su ridiculo intento de desarmar y agredir a la RPDC con EE.UU. A esto se llama la gran absurdidad igual a esperar el derrumbe del cielo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas peroratas del traidor resultan para la RPDC la declaracion de confrontacion total entre los regimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl decirlas, el traidor Lee mostro por si solo que el es responsable principal de la quiebra total de las relaciones N-S y de la actual situacion al borde de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pagara muy caro su disparate del \"impuesto de la reunificacion\", anotado en el texto de su discurso y pronunciado por si mismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe convendria mas ocuparse de los asuntos de su casa a punto de arruinarse en lugar de abrigar la absurda ambicion de atentar el regimen ajeno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la banda traidora marcha hasta el final por el camino de enfrentamiento, la RPDC tambien saldra a su encuentro."
