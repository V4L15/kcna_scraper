Paektu is the source of the invincible might of the Korean People's Army (KPA), says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA's spirit of Mt. Paektu was created in the anti-Japanese revolutionary war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This fierce war was fought against an imperialist formidable enemy armed to the teeth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean revolutionary armed forces achieved the liberation of the country by defeating the Japanese imperialists who were incomparably superior to them in numerical strength and military technique. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The victory in the anti-Japanese war demonstrated the might of the Korean revolutionary armed forces who fought in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The anti-Japanese guerrillas were possessed of the indomitable spirit of crushing the enemy even if they might die a hundred times and superb war methods and tactics of beating any formidable enemy. This staunch spirit enabled them to work miracles unprecedented in the world war history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A vigorous drive is now under way in the KPA to learn from the mode of the anti-Japanese guerrillas in training and their way of life and fight. Prevalent in the army are confidence of sure victory and optimism that it can emerge victorious under any circumstances only if there are water and air. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA has inherited the spirit of Mt. Paektu in the course of struggling for nearly 70 years under the leadership of the three commanders of Mt. Paektu and this spirit has become disposition peculiar to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three commanders of Mt. Paektu, considering it as a vital issue related to the destiny of the fatherland and the revolution to strengthen and develop the revolutionary army, have built revolutionary armed forces capable of providing a sure guarantee for the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms. This was the greatest exploit performed by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The invincible might of the KPA which fights in the spirit of Mt. Paektu finds a vivid expression in its prodigious grit and matchless audacity and in the bold spirit of dealing deadly blows to the reckless enemies. It is clearly manifested in the KPA's way of life and struggle full of revolutionary optimism. \r\n\r\n"
