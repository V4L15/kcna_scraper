This is, however, nothing but a rash act of a political dwarf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe gentries paint the unfriendly action taken against Chongryon as a \"mere business issue related to the collection of bonds.\" But this is a political plot and criminal move to deprive Chongryon of the centre of its activities and destroy it. With nothing can they deny this hard fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No previous regimes of Japan have ever resorted to such frantic campaign to stamp out Chongryon as what the Abe group is now perpetrating. They refrained from such action as they were aware even a little of the fact that Chongryon is a legitimate overseas compatriots' organization of the DPRK whose mission is to protect the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan, the victims of the criminal forcible drafting of Koreans committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and their descendants, and they are legally and morally  responsible for guaranteeing the activities of Chongryon on the basis of their recognition of its existence because of the historical background. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Abe gentries have rolled up their sleeves to carry out their operation to destroy Chongryon. This self-exposes that they are a group of villains and gangsters who do not feel any legal and moral responsibility for the crimes committed by Japan in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their action to deprive Chongryon of its building and plottage despite the fact that it has played the role of a mission of the DPRK in Japan is, in fact, a wanton infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group is seeking a sinister aim through its anti-Chongryon campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The escalated suppression of Chongryon is pushing the DPRK-Japan relations to the lowest ebb and driving the six-party talks to a collapse. It is the ulterior intention of the Abe gentries to stand in the way of the six-party talks and use them for meeting their political and strategic interests.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pero, resulta irrefutable que ese complot politico y acto criminal parten de su malvada intencion de eliminar ese centro de actividades de la Chongryon y dar punto final a la misma existencia de esta.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Ninguno de los gobiernos anteriores de Japon se mostro tan frenetico como la banda de Abe en las maniobras para exterminar la Chongryon. Es porque estuvieron conscientes, aunque tenuemente, de que ella es una legitima organizacion de los compatriotas de la RPDC en ultramar fundada para defender los derechos nacionales democraticos de los coreanos residentes en Japon, quienes son victimas directas del criminal arresto forzado a los coreanos perpetrado en el pasado por los imperialistas nipones o sus descendientes, y de que por tales causas historicas, les pesa la responsabilidad legal y moral de reconocer su existencia y garantizar sus actividades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, los pandilleros al mando de Abe se muestran mas entusiastas que nadie en el hostigamiento a la Chongryon revelando su identidad de gangsteres que ni siquiera tienen cargos de conciencia legal y moral por sus crimenes del pasado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El intento de arrebatar hasta el edificio y la tierra de la Chongryon, que funciona como una representacion de la RPDC en Japon, significa un flagrante atentado a la dignidad y soberania del primer pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al recrudecer la represion a la Chongryon, Abe pretende llevar a la peor fase las relaciones con la RPDC para quebrar finalmente las conversaciones a 6 bandas.
