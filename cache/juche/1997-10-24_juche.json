The rackets are motivated by the criminal attempt to block the improvement of relations. The smear campaign is related to the intrigues of the south Korean Agency for National Security Planning. No matter how wild the puppets of south Korea in league with the Japanese right-wing gangsters may run, it is a foolish act.\r\n   The commentary strongly urges the Japanese authorities to inflict a stern punishment on the criminals for their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon smear campaign and take a relevant step so that such happenings should not be repeated. \r\n\r\n"
