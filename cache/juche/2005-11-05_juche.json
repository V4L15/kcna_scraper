He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung fathered the Juche idea and built a unique socialist country centered on the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is successfully protecting the sovereignty and dignity of the country with the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are highly proud of having awarded our university's honorable doctorate to him in 2001 in high recognition of his ideological and theoretical exploits.\r\n Head of a chair of the university N. Bold noted that the imperialists are increasing pressure upon the DPRK such as economic sanctions and blockade in an attempt to deter it from advancing along the road of independence. But the Korean people are firmly defending the sovereignty of their country, meeting all challenges of the imperialists, under the banner of the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il, he added: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the most developed socialist country centered on the popular masses quite different from what the Western countries say about it. \r\n He said he would conduct positive activities for the study of the Juche idea including the holding of seminars and briefings so as to help more many teachers and students grasp the advantages of Korean-style socialism and expand the ranks of the centre.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Korea Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. forces side in south Korea whisked away their soldier, who ruthlessly drove a truck over a south Korean woman to death in Tongduchon, Kyonggi Province in June last, without any trial or punishment, claiming that he did not do anything wrong. This fact was disclosed by south Korean media recently.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Friday observes that this arbitrary practice of the U.S. forces is nothing but a repetition of their killing of Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son. It denounces the case as a crime against the Korean nation, a clear indication of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops' arrogant behavior of damaging its dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression troops do not consider the killing of civilians as a crime and take their man-killing no more serious than pilfering.\r\n The U.S. is not in a position to talk about someone's \"human rights performance\" and it is, indeed, a human rights abuser that should face an international human rights trial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are ample facts to prove this. The recent murder of a south Korean woman by the U.S. aggression troop there and their manner whereby they handled the case heighten the south Korean's vigilance against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent murder case as horrendous as the killing of Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son will continue to occur and put the south Koreans in a nightmare of horror and disgrace as long as the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, a huge group of human ogres defying law and reason, remain in south Korea.\r\n The reality requires the south Korean people to stage the same anti-U.S. candlelight demonstrations as what raged in south Korea three years ago, making the U.S. shudder in order not to suffer bigger national misfortune and disgrace due to the occupation forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their transfer of the firing range will neither change nor cover up their aggressive and bellicose nature, he noted, and continued: \r\n The U.S. troops built a firing range in Maehyang-ri, Hwasong city, Kyonggi Province for their exclusive use and have since conducted madcap mock nuclear bomb-dropping exercises, bombing and firing drills almost everyday for the past 50 years, thus severely devastating the ecological environment in the region and inflicting unspeakable disasters and misfortune upon its inhabitants. \r\n Enraged by the forces' moves for a war of aggression and atrocities, south Koreans have conducted dynamic actions demanding the U.S. forces' withdrawal and the closure of the U.S. military bases in different parts of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the U.S. is staging the farce of closing the Maehyang-ri firing range and transferring it to Jik Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to free the Korean Peninsula from the danger of war nor is it possible to prevent the same tragedy as what happened in Maehyang-ri as long as the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, chieftain of aggression, war, man-slaughtering and destruction, remain in south Korea.\r\n The spokesman denounced the south Korean bellicose forces for their thrice-cursed traitorous act of toeing the U.S. line and offering part of the inviolable territory of Korea to the U.S. forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
