            "content": "KCNA Slashes at Japan's Intention to Play Bad Role at Six-Party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- The international community is sincerely expecting a successful resumption of the six-party talks after an agreement was made on the resumption of the talks.\r\n However, it is only Japan that behaves quite contrary to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n No sooner had this agreement been made public than the Japanese government authorities vied with each other to impertinently cry out that someone should not be allowed to participate in the talks, stunning the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, Japanese Foreign Minister Aso let loose once again sophism that the six-party talks should be resumed on the premise that north Korea abandons its nuclear program and that it is natural to include the \"abduction issue\" in their agenda. And the head of the Japanese delegation to the six-party talks oft-repeated this nonsense after flying into Beijing for \"prior consultation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly indicates that Japan will play once again a very bad role at the six-party talks slated to be resumed in future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, we cannot but recall the negative role Japan has played at the six-party talks so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Backing the U.S. wrong stance, Japan has hindered a fair solution of the nuclear issue. It raised the \"abduction issue\" which has nothing to do with the agenda of the talks, poisoning the atmosphere of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Japan did in the past has a thread of connection with what it is perpetrating at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no change in Japan's stand on the talks though new political forces came to power. They are getting so frantic in their moves to scuttle the talks even before their resumption. What do they seek through this? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula that Japan is so zealously joining the U.S. in its anti-DPRK campaign as its stooge and shock brigade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the objective of Japan to drag on the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to find a pretext for emerging a military power and thus realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has refused to recognize the self-defensive nature of the DPRK's missiles and nuclear weapons, preposterously claiming that its nuclear weapons pose a great \"threat\" to Japan's security. This is intended to accelerate the establishment of \"the missile defense system\" and step up its moves to go nuclear under the above-mentioned pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is desperately obstructing the fair solution of the nuclear issue on the peninsula in a bid to achieve such political and military aims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite obvious that Japan will do nothing but bad at the talks even if it is allowed to attend them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, the international community is disillusioned with the unchangeable stance of Japan towards the talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves for Nuclear War Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- Japan is working hard to totally nullify the provision banning \"the exercise of right to collective self-defence\" and calling for the observance of the \"three non-nuclear principles\" it has ostensively advocated. High-ranking officials of the Japanese government including Prime Minister Abe and brasshats are kicking up a racket, crying out for expanding the sphere of application of the missile defence system (MD) and asserting that Japan may allow the passage of warships carrying nukes through its territorial waters in \"contingency.\"\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' above-said call for the expansion of the sphere of application of MD in fact means allowing the exercise of \"right to collective self-defence\" and betrays their intention to secure a premise for Japan's involvement in nuclear war. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1967 the Japanese government set forth the \"three non-nuclear principles\" that ban Japan from possessing, producing or allowing nuclear weapons on its territory\". But it has used them as window-dressing for showcasing its  \"peace-loving stand\" because none of those principles has been observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Behind the curtain of the \"three non-nuclear principles\", Japan has pushed forward its moves for converting it into a nuclear base and realizing its nuclear weaponization under the patronage of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have become evermore undisguised in their moves to jump into nuclear war, completely discarding their oft-repeated \"three non-nuclear principles.\" This is clearly evidenced by the Japanese reactionaries' intention to permit the passage of warships carrying nukes through the territorial waters of Japan. They seek to fish in troubled waters by allowing the passage of those warships through the territorial waters of Japan to please their master, in utter disregard of the \"three non-nuclear principles\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing themselves of the change in the international situation and the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which has reached an extreme phase, the Japanese reactionaries are zealously joining their master in the moves to launch a nuclear war in a bid to realize their wild militaristic ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's pursuance of the above-mentioned dangerous plan is as foolish an act as inviting a nuclear disaster by itself.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
