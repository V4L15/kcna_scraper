The homogeneous Korean people who love the country and nation more than anybody else and have a strong capacity for united action have failed to achieve reconciliation and unity because the South Korean ruling quarters do not stand true to the principle of national independence.\r\n   With the successive rulers of South Korea pursuing the policy of dependence on outside forces the unity of the nation has not yet been achieved. Any one who truly wants inter-Korean reconciliation and national unity should take the road of national independence, not dependence on outsiders.\r\n   The Chondoist Chongu Party will carry through the five-point policy of great national unity which developed President Kim Il Sung's idea of great national unity to meet the requirements of the present times, and greatly help achieve the great unity of the entire nation in reliance upon the full display of spirit of the singlehearted unity.\r\n   She expressed the belief that all the religionists and people of other social strata of South Korea, including Chondoists, will actively join in a nationwide struggle for the full implementation of the five-point policy of the great unity of the entire nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only when all the Koreans in the north, south and overseas are united under the banner of national reunification and make free and sincere discussions, can a reasonable and realistic way for reunification be found.\r\n   He urged the South Korean authorities to affirmatively respond to the proposal for reunification through confederation and the five-point policy of great national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
