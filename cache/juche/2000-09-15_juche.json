This was disclosed at a time when Japanese middle schools are making applications for the examination of their history textbooks according to new school guidance program to begin in the year 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this connection Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such undisguised moves of Japan to justify its history of aggression are reported at a time when the world is about to greet a new century and the issues of redeeming its past and establishing diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan are high on their agenda. This, therefore, can not be construed otherwise than a very grave and dangerous development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"treaties\" which Japan claims it had \"concluded\" with Korea are all forgeries and fabrications and products of coercion in contravention of principles governing the international laws and requirements of international usage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey were illegitimate aggressive ones aimed to realise its military occupation and rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is illogical to say that they were \"needed,\" \"supported\" and \"legitimate.\" Japan's claim is an unpardonable insult and challenge to the Korean people, a victim, and a mockery of the public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's undisguised moves to tamper with history textbooks by adding to them contents asserting the legitimacy of the \"Korea-Japan annexation treaty\" and the validity of its rule over Korea clearly reflect the social atmosphere in Japan where militarization and its preparations for reinvasion are rapidly stepped up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is closely following the moves of the Japanese militarist forces to justify its past history of aggression of Korea. \r\n\r\n"
