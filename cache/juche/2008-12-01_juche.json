This plane perpetrated such espionage dozens of times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Overseas-based RC-135 of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces flew in the air above south Korea to make shuttle flights for committing aerial observation and photographing of the depth of the DPRK and all its other areas on Nov. 14 and 19. Their RC-12 and RC-7B numbering three perpetrated similar espionage on Nov. 29.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many tactical reconnaissance and commanding planes of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet armed forces with different missions were busy flying in the sky over the frontline areas to conduct intensive aerial espionage against the DPRK. The number of such type planes involved reached at least 50 from Nov. 1 to 8 when Hoguk joint war exercises for aggression were underway and more than 10 on Nov. 26 when combined air battle exercises were kicked off. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Two or three RC-800s and RF-4Cs of the war-like forces of the south Korean puppet armed forces made shuttle flights round-the-clock almost every day to perpetrate aerial observation and espionage against areas of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aerial espionage timed to coincide with the Hoguk joint war exercises, fleet mobile war exercises and combined air battle exercises clearly indicates that the wild ambition of the U.S. imperialists and warmongers of the south Korean puppet armed forces to make a surprise preemptive attack on the DPRK has reached an extreme phase."
