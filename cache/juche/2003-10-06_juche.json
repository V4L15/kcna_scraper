            "content": "U.S. Advised to Face Up to Trend of Times \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 5 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the former U.S. ambassador to south Korea and the former assistant to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, strongly criticized the Bush administration's policy toward Korea, holding that the Bush administration's assertion can not get any understanding of the countries participating in the six-way talks as it is unacceptable in any case.\r\n Even Pritchard, who was in charge of negotiations with the DPRK in the administration, said that the Bush administration's policy toward the DPRK would get it nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: The reality shows that the international community is unanimous in demanding the U.S. give up its hostile policy toward the DPRK at an early date and take a positive stand for solving the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. The U.S. should face up to the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now styling itself a \"superpower\". But if it fails to face up to the trend of the times and goes against it, it will lose its position on the international arena and will be forsaken by history in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should give up its hostile policy toward the DPRK and conclude a non-aggression treaty with it. This is the only way to settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. Any other option but this does not bring any interest to the DPRK nor work on it. The DPRK does not require such option at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. unilateralism and big stick policy are futile before the DPRK. The Bush administration should not defy the reality any longer if it has a shred of reason. It is beneficial for the U.S. itself\r\n\r\n"

He called upon the south Korean people to turn out as one in the struggle to resolutely reject and check the criminal plan to drive their beloved sons to death and protect the dignity and honor of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

On this day UNESCO is awarding certificates of qualification and medals to those teachers who have distinguished themselves in the development of the education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The position and role of the teachers in the DPRK have remarkably increased thanks to the wise measures taken by the Workers' Party of Korea and the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The teachers in the DPRK are highly regarded as career revolutionaries and a trait of treating them with respect and hospitality prevails throughout the society.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Diplomatic Chief's Remarks under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- Japan's diplomatic chief recently pulled up the DPRK over the issue of abduction and nuclear development in a speech made at the 58th session of the UN General Assembly. And Motomura, Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, said that he never thinks that the issue of abduction has been solved.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of abducting several Japanese about which the Japanese government talked much has already been settled by the adoption of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in September last year. Lurking behind the row kicked up by Japan over the issue of abduction is a sinister intention to internationalize this issue in a bid to tarnish the image of the DPRK in the international arena and evade its responsibility to liquidate its past at any cost under the pretext of the issue. \r\n The Japanese chief executive admitted to Japan's crimes in the past and committed himself to redeem it in the declaration. The Japanese government is, therefore, obliged to honestly reflect on the hideous criminal acts the Japanese imperialists committed in Korea in the past and opt for redeeming the crimes before talking about the issue of abduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's liquidation of its past is the core of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan is in a position to remain true to the spirit of the declaration and implement it, it should, first of all, redeem its past. The normalization of relations between the DPRK and Japan can never be expected nor can it happen without Japan's liquidation of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's negative attitude towards the issue of redeeming its past can not be construed otherwise than its refusal to respect the declaration and fulfil its obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's liquidation of its past is not a simple humanitarian issue that it may sidestep but a serious political and international issue and historical task pending a solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan relations will never improve unless Japan redresses its past including the probe into the truth behind the unprecedented crimes it committed against the Korean people and its honest apology and compensation for them.    \r\n\r\n"

He formulated the line and policies for national reunification advanced by the President including the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo based on the Juche character and national identity as the three charters of national reunification, thus providing important guidelines that all Koreans desirous of reunification should hold fast to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation's cause of reunification has greeted its best days. This is ascribable to the pro-reunification patriotic leadership of Kim Jong Il who, considering all problems from a Juche-oriented viewpoint and solving them on the principle of national independence, has steered the cause of reunification on the basis of the excellent national character. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
