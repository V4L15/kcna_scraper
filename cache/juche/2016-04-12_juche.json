Paektu and the spirit of the red flag and an elite matchless army having ultra-modern striking means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He initiated the movement for becoming crack shots and personally organized and commanded various operations and combat trainings to make sure that the entire army intensified the military training the way the anti-Japanese guerrillas did in Mt. Paektu so that all service personnel are trained as stalwart fighters capable of waging modern warfare, possessed of Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's strategy and tactics, heroic fighting spirit and perfect capability to fight an actual war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He laid down the new line of simultaneously developing the two fronts and energetically led the work for steadily making the defence industry more Juche-oriented, modern and scientific and developing and producing more diverse and powerful weapons and equipment of Korean-style, thereby further consolidating the material and technical foundation of self-reliant defence capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK emerged the strongest nuclear power possessed of even H-bomb. This is one of the greatest feats he performed for the country and nation and for the victory of the Juche revolution and the people's cause of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is the great statesman and great master of leadership as he provided a new springboard for building a great thriving nation by ushering in a new great era of creation and changes with his distinguished political caliber and tested and seasoned leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called on all party members and service personnel and people to firmly protect Kim Jong Un politically and ideologically and with their lives and single-mindedly remain loyal to him with the national pride of having the peerlessly great man at the top posts of the party, state and army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All service personnel and people will never tolerate the reckless provocations of the U.S. imperialists and their followers to block the advance of the DPRK and stifle its ideology, cause and socialist system but resolutely foil them by dint of justice and wage a positive struggle for the independent reunification of the country, global peace and security and the cause of human independence, the reporter stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on all the service personnel and people to wage an all-out charge to glorify the Seventh Congress of the WPK with high political enthusiasm and unprecedented labor achievements and bring earlier the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche and future of a reunified thriving nation, united close behind Kim Jong Un."

Nevertheless, some countries are talking about the six-party talks, simultaneous pushing forward of denuclearization and the conclusion of a peace treaty and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven a mere child knows well that dialogue is impossible under the present tense situation on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is only the danger of nuclear clash on the Korean peninsula due to the unprecedented U.S.-south Korea joint military drills for aggression and the entirely just measures taken by the Korean People's Army to cope with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDialogue should be based on mutual respect and equality among its parties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK doesn't oppose dialogue but categorically rejects any unequal dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the DPRK's consistent and principled stand not to have a dialogue under unilateral pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDialogue and military threat, dialogue and sanctions can never go together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch logic that the purpose of imposing sanctions is to have a dialogue can never work on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDue to the ever-escalating hostile acts of the U.S., the nuclear issue of the DPRK has long been away from its negotiating table.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's proposal that it would put a moratorium on its nuclear test in return for the U.S. halt to the joint war drills would no longer be valid as the latter turned it down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs already clarified by the DPRK, it will steadily and dynamically push ahead with its line of simultaneously pushing forward the two fronts until the world is denuclearized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe urgent issue to be settled on the Korean peninsula is to put a definite end to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, the root cause of all problems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhether the issue would be solved through dialogue and negotiations or through other methods entirely depends on the attitude of the U.S."

In case the puppet group does not send them back, it will have to pay a high price for the serious consequences to be entailed by its action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should bear in mind that unless they apologize for the hideous abduction and send those abductees back, they will face unimaginable serious consequences and severe punishment."

En tales condiciones algunas partes sueltan disparates de las conversaciones a 6 bandas y la realizacion paralela de la desnuclearizacion y la concertacion del convenio de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy conocido por todos el que la actual situacion de la Peninsula Coreana no da ningun ambiente a pensar en el dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA consecuencia de los agresivos ejercicios militares conjuntos EE.UU.-Sur de Corea sin precedentes en la historia y las justas medidas autodefensivas de nuestro ejercito tomadas frente a ellos, en la misma Peninsula queda solo la confrontacion nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dialogo es el medio de las partes interesadas basado en el respeto mutuo y la igualdad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo negamos el dialogo mismo, pero rechazamos cabalmente el dialogo desigual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra invariable posicion de principio es que bajo la presion unilateral, nunca podemos tomar parte en el dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon incompatibles el dialogo y la amenaza militar, el dialogo y la sancion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es aceptable para nosotros la logica absurda de que el objetivo de la sancion es para realizar el dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a los recrudescentes actos hostiles de EE.UU., el problema nuclear de la RPDC no tiene que ver con el dialogo ya desde hace mucho tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa se quedo invalida nuestra propuesta sobre el cese del simulacro militar conjunto vs el cese de prueba nuclear, dado que el mismo EE.UU. la rechazo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya hemos declarado, nuestra linea de desarrollo paralelo seguira con vigor hasta que se logre la desnuclearizacion mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema primordial a ser resuelto en la Peninsula Coreana es precisamente el fin completo de la politica de hostilidad anti-RPDC de EE.UU., que genera todos los problemas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolucionar por medio del dialogo y la negociacion o de otra manera depende enteramente de la conducta de EE.UU."
