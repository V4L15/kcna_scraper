Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTill the last moments of his great life he covered more than 669 844 km for field guidance, the distance equal to 17 round-the earth trips, defending the country, the revolution and socialism despite unprecedented adversity and opening a new history of building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe organized a group for study tour of revolutionary battle sites, the first of its kind in the DPRK, in June 1956, exploring the way of historic tour of areas of Mt.

He visited Kangson on Dec. 24, 2008 and kindled a torch for a new surge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe last three years of his life was a review of his popular and heroic life as a legendary great man unprecedented in history as he made tours day and night as a standard bearer in the ranks of the onward movement for a great surge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn those days he visited nearly 1 000 units. He conducted ceaseless forced marches despite snowstorm and sultriness day and night. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il performed undying feats on behalf of the era, the revolution, the country and the nation with his outstanding ideas and theories, extraordinary leadership, iron-willed faith and superman-like energy. As he was totally dedicated to the revolution all his life, he was aboard a train till the last moments of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe made his whole life shine with self-sacrificing forced marches, enduring pent-up mental and physical stress and illness with his superman-like energy. Thanks to the devotion and indefatigable efforts of the peerlessly great man, an eternal foundation for a thriving socialist country has been laid on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the servicepersons and people of the DPRK will consider the revolutionary history of forced marches made by Kim Jong Il as an eternal treasure of Songun Korea and dash ahead like the wind, keeping pace with the footsteps of the dear respected Kim Jong Un and thus commemorate the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung with victories and usher in new years of prosperity, concluded the report."

He said this on March 13 as regards the international trend of approaching humanitarian aid issue apart from political issue.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese government has reportedly embarked on readjusting its sanctions on the DPRK in the direction of extending them one more year. The sanctions originated from the \"abduction issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis again offers a glimpse into Japan's wicked nature as a political dwarf which has been brought to light more often than not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities' oft-repeated talk about the \"abduction issue\", which had already seen a solution, is aimed to silence the international voices demanding Japan's redemption of its hideous crimes against humanity, and evade apology and reparation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs universally recognized, no statute of limitations is applicable to the crimes against humanity committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey drafted more than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans, forcing them into medieval slavery or hurling them as cannon fodder into battlefields for aggression. They killed over one million Koreans in cold blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey also forced 200 000 Korean women to provide sex to the Japanese beasts during the wartime, violating their youth and chastity. They even massacred them to cover up their monstrous crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStill ringing out across the country are bitter voices of the victims cursing the Japanese imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInternational voices demanding reparation for the Japanese imperialists' past crimes have become more assertive now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolidarity actions to secure formal apology and reparation from Japan took place in more than 40 cities in U.S., Germany, Canada, Italy and many other countries and regions on December 14 last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA monument was built in New Jersey to recall people to the Imperial Japanese Army's sexual slavery crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts show that Japan is still in the dock as regards the human rights issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan, which has not yet shaken off the ill fame as an enemy state, is resorting to a sleight of hand to stave off a flurry of international protest and censure, under the veil of the \"victims to abduction\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan's crafty and sordid behavior will only add to the crimes it committed in the past."

One of the secrets of its victory was the idea of army-civilian unity maintained in the struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn those days activists for the national liberation movement in Korea failed to have confidence in the strength of its people, insisting on the existing theory on the national liberation in colonial countries and seeking to win the independence of the country with the backing of big powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, Kim Il Sung was of the view that national sovereignty can be won and defended only by the nation's own efforts and, on the basis of this view he founded the KPRA relying on the popular masses with a strong sense of patriotism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe excellent trait of army-civilian unity, created by him for the first time in history, made the KPRA emerge victorious in every battle with the enemies though it had neither state-backing home front nor other country's assistance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"As fish cannot live without water, so guerrillas cannot live without the people.\" This was the way of the KPRA's existence and principle of its activities set by him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are many touching stories about the army-civilian unity created during the anti-Japanese armed struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmong them are a story \"Commander is also a son of the people\" and a story about the KPRA returning cattle granted by inhabitants with sincerity. The members of the KPRA regarded it as their life and soul to protect people's life and property.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the guerrillas infringed upon the interests of people, the President strictly reproached them, saying if they did not respect the people they would turn their faces away from them and that winning over the people was the most important thing for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"KPRA Provisional Rules and Regulations\" he personally worked out in December Juche 25 (1936) represented the character of the guerrilla army giving top priority to the people's interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeeply moved by the character, they sincerely assisted the KPRA, not wavered by any sorts of the enemy's allurement and deception.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the mid-1930s, the Japanese imperialists built concentration villages everywhere in a bid to block the people from access to the guerrilla army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, in the teeth of their repression, people provided the guerrillas with food and clothes, with the belief that assisting them was the only way for liberating Korea,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, President Kim Il Sung had considered the spirit of self-reliance to be one of factors for victory in fighting the Japanese imperialists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt that time, the guerrilla army always lacked weapons, munitions and other supplies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInspired by his spirit of self-reliance, the guerrillas armed themselves with their own efforts, repaired weapons and manufactured bombs, called \"Yanji bomb\", by themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith needles made with a file, they did not stop operating sewing machines, finishing the production of some 600 uniforms in time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCarrying forward the army-civilian unity and the spirit of self-reliance, displayed in the days of the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the Korean people could defeat the U.S. imperialists in the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-July 1953). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy dint of the unity, the Korean people will always emerge victorious in their efforts for the prosperity of the country."

This is the real intention of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnother reason is that the Iranian war may create difficulties in the way of implementing its new defense strategy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe keynote of the new U.S. defense strategy is to reduce the U.S. forces and attach importance to the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. may fail in the strategy if it is locked in the Iranian war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn case the Hormuz Strait under the control of Iran, in particular, is blocked due to the war, it will spark off a serious oil crisis and deal a deadly blow at the Western economy. A small mistake may cause the U.S. to lose its allies and invite rebuff and criticism from all sides and, more seriously, fail in its policy of attaching importance to Asia-Pacific. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe present international environment is one of the reasons why the U.S. refrains from making a hasty decision as regards Iran's issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. can never carry out its scenario for invasion of Iran without the help of Mideast countries. Countries of the region are taking a high-profile attitude, saying they will not allow the U.S. to use them as bases for attacking Iran. Under this situation, the U.S. is thinking twice about the issue of attack on Iran."

            "content": "Minju Joson revela ambicion militarista de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 20 de marzo (ACNC) -- Segun trascendidos, el gobierno japones inicio la revision para enmendar la \"ley de cooperacion en las actividades de la ONU por el mantenimiento de la paz\", cuya meta principal es aliviar la norma sobre el uso de armas de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" participantes en las \"actividades de la ONU por el mantenimiento de la paz\" en ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobierno japones presenta como motivo de la enmienda de la ley la \"proteccion\" y la \"autodefensa\" a los militares y civiles durante las \"actividades de la ONU por el mantenimiento de la paz\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, esto no pasa de ser una artimana para enganar a otros y justificar su designio malintencionado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRevela asi el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual de este martes y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa astucia y el cinismo caracterizan la naturaleza de los politiqueros japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses, enloquecidos por la ambicion militarista y expansionista, se empenaron desde hace mucho tiempo por modificar el articulo 9 de la constitucion actual, mientras analizando a su favor la constitucion, establecieron sucesivamente nuevas leyes tales como la \"ley de cooperacion en las actividades de la ONU por el mantenimiento de la paz\" (1992) y la \"ley de medidas especiales contra el terrorismo\" (octubre de 2001) y abrieron el camino de avance a ultramar de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses, insatisfechos con esto, pretenden facilitar a las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" enviadas a ultramar desarrollar sin restriccion alguna las actividades militares agresivas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui el motivo principal de la pretension de los reaccionarios japoneses para aliviar la norma sobre el uso de armas en ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos evidencian que Japon persigue la agresion y la guerra, en lugar de la paz, y acelera los preparativos para ese fin.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos politicos japoneses no deben olvidar el fin tragico de sus antecesores que llevaron al pais a la derrota amarga persiguiendo la linea de guerra."
