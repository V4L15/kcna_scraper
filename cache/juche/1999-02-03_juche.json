This is the most urgent task common to the Korean people this year.\r\n    He proposed, as immediate measures, to let the authorities in the north and south and political parties and organisations at home and abroad set this year as a \"year of national independence and great unity,\" adhere to the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--and have a wide-range dialogue between the north and south, including the talks between authorities, at an early date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    He said for reunification-oriented dialogue it is necessary to do away with anti-DPRK \"cooperation\" with outsiders, an obstacle in the way of national reunification, discontinue joint military maneuvers, abolish the \"National Security Law\" and ensure the reunification movement and free activities of pro-reunification patriotic organisations and figures in South Korea. \r\n   He proposed to the South Korean authorities to have inter-Korean high-level political talks in the second half of the year following the implementation of the above-mentioned measures.\r\n   He said that a measure to implement the north-south agreement which was signed by the north and the south after reaffirming  the three principles of national reunification should be a basic agenda item at the high-level political talks and besides, the immediate problems arising in inter-Korean relations including the issue of cooperation and exchange and the issue of alleviating the sufferings of the separated families and relatives, which our side had proposed long ago, may be discussed at the talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He continued:   The South Korean authorities should not turn their back on this fair and aboveboard proposal of ours but abandon the habit of accepting our proposal faithlessly. They should ponder over it, make a comprehensive study of it and earnestly accept it in practice.\r\n  Then followed speeches of Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the c.c, the Korean Social Democratic Party, Choe Ki Ryong, Minister of Education, Ryom Sun Gil, chairman of the c.c., the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, and Pak Thae Hwa, vice-chairman of the north headquarters of Pomminryon and chairman of the c.c., the Korean Buddhist Federation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organisations and people from all walks of life at home and abroad was adopted at the joint meeting.\r\n   The letter proposed to define 1999 as a \"year of national independence and great unity\" and, to this end, pool strength and resourcefulness of the whole nation. \r\n   All the fellow countrymen in the south should hold fast to independence and the great unity of the nation as the banner of patriotism, check and frustrate the U.S. war moves and resolutely reject flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders that bring about a war, the letter said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It urged the South Korean authorities, political parties and organisations to take a decisive step to determinedly break away with flunkeyism and sycophancy and take the road of genuine independence and great national unity.\r\n   The letter called for honestly implementing the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.\r\n   Stressing the three principles are a reunification program common to the nation the north and the south  agreed upon and declared before the nation, it held that the South Korean authorities, political parties and organisations should take a step to fix them as the principle of activities for national reunification and as the basis of the policy toward the north.\r\n   They should also renounce all the phoney \"principles\" and \"bases\" contrary to the three principles, it said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letter proposed to arrange authorities' dialogues and other wide-ranging dialogues between the north and south.\r\n   In order for the north-south dialogue to take a new step as a true reunification-oriented dialogue, practical measures for removing the stumbling-block of dialogue should first be taken in South Korea -- to repeal \"cooperation\" with foreign forces against the DPRK,  stop the joint military  exercises, abolish the \"National Security Law\" and provide the freedom of movement and activities for reunification to the patriotic organisations and public figures,  the letter noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The faster such practical steps are taken, the better, the letter said, proposing to the South Korean authorities to have north-south high-level political talks in the second half of this year after the steps are taken in the first half of the year at latest.\r\n   The letter expressed the hope that the South Korean authorities and political parties, organisations and public figures of all strata in the north, south and overseas will actively respond to the DPRK's patriotic appeal intended to adorn the 2000s as a hopeful decade of national reunification by removing the danger of war and making a new breakthrough for national reunification this year under the banner of national independence and great unity.\r\n \r\n"

The patriotic hammer held up by the Korean people in building a powerful nation is a hammer to realize his ideology. The militant spirit of socialist Korea running at a canter stems from the might of his ideology.\r\n   His ideology is great in that it is a revolutionary idea full of absolute loyalty to the respected Kim Il Sung's ideology and cause, the encyclopedia and almighty instrument of the revolution and construction which proves its worth in solving any difficult and complex problems of the present era. His ideology is also great in that it is a revolutionary idea whose truth and justness  have fully been proved in revolutionary practice of tens of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il defined the \"Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" which was amended, supplemented and adopted at the first session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly as Kim Il Sung's constitution and took a revolutionary step to hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the eternal President of the DPRK. The definition and step fully reflect his boundless loyalty to the preceding leader's ideology and cause.\r\n   The revolutionary policy of bringing about a fresh advance in building a powerful nation through the second grand march of Chollima shows his firm will to lead the Korean revolution as the President did.\r\n   When socialism suffered setbacks in some countries and the imperialists and renegades were zealously slandering socialism with this as an occasion, his ideology gave a  scientific exposition of the truth behind the collapse and clearly indicated the way of victory to defend socialism. It imbued  a lot of people who were bewildered by the collapse with the faith that socialism is just and it is sure to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The monolithic unity of Korea is gaining momentum thanks to the greatness of his ideology.  The invincible might of the revolutionary armed forces traces back to his idea of attaching importance to the military affairs.  The indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean people in the \"arduous march\" and the forced march is based on his spirit of independence.\r\n   All his ideas, theories and policies have clear targets and ways of putting them into practice. They serve as great guidelines capturing the minds of the people.\r\n   His idea has been a source of certain victory of decades. \r\nIt is, indeed, the eternal guiding idea and militant banner of the revolution in all the historical times of humankind. \r\n\r\n"
