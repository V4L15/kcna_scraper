De esta manera, perpetro los ilegales y atroces actos provocativos de poner en practica la sancion contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Estas sanciones no podran aceptarse en absoluto para la RPDC que durante decenas de anos ha venido viviendo bajo toda clase de sanciones y bloqueo de las fuerzas hostiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo mas grave es que el CS de la ONU, insatisfecho de haber violado flagrantemente la soberania del Estado soberano adhiriendose a las maniobras de EE.UU., tomo ahora el camino de atentar directamente la seguridad del pais y la nacion, supremo interes de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al no alcanzar su objeto de desarmarnos mediante las conversaciones a 6 bandas, las fuerzas hostiles  abrigan ahora la ilusion vana de asfixiar de manera fisica nuestra industria de defensa nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya en la decada de 1990 declaramos que si la ONU, parte juridicamente interesada en el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea, aplica la sancion contra la RPDC lo consideraremos como destruccion de ese acuerdo, es decir como la declaracion de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Frente a la situacion grave en que debido a las maquinaciones de las fuerzas hostiles se desaparecio eternamente el anhelo de la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana junto con las conversaciones a 6 bandas y la situacion llega al borde de la guerra, el MINREX de la RPDC advierte severamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El CS  de la ONU debe pedir disculpa de inmediato por su atentado a la soberania de la RPDC y revocar  la \"resolucion\" y las decisiones anti-RPDC aprobadas injusta y discriminadamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto deviene la unica salida para que el CS de la ONU pueda cumplir con su responsabilidad de mantener la paz y la seguridad internacionales recuperando la confianza de los paises miembros de la ONU sin ser violado por mas tiempo como instrumento de la coaccion y la arbitrariedad de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si el CS de la ONU no pide disculpa de inmediato por el respecto la RPDC actuara como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Primero, nos veremos obligados a tomar las adicionales medidas autodefensivas para defender su interes supremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En ellas se incluiran el ensayo nuclear y el de lanzamiento de misiles balisticos intercontinentales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segundo, tomara la decision de la construccion de la central de reactor de agua ligera y, como su primer proceso, iniciara sin demora el desarrollo de tecnicas para producir y asegurar por su propia cuenta los combustibles nucleares."

Con tales actos desesperados no puede impedir jamas el sentimiento de los surcoreanos inclinado hacia el Norte y su fervorosa aspiracion a la reunificacion independiente en alianza con el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi, la banda de Lee se aferra tercamente de los actos traidores y de la violencia fascista nadando contra la corriente de la tendencia general, pero adelantara solo su aislamiento y el fracaso politico de si misma."
