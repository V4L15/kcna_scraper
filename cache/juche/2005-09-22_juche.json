It goes on: \r\n The Korean People's Army will fully embody the idea and spirit reflected in the joint slogans and demonstrate the spirit of the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint slogans set it as the primary task for bolstering the military muscle to turn the whole army into the militant ranks devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the joint slogans is \"Let the whole army wage the O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment Movement forcefully to become the first death-defying corps and first human bullets and bombs in defending the headquarters of the revolution!\" The joint slogans call for establishing the WPK's commanding system and revolutionary military discipline throughout the army and urge all the servicepersons to become the most ardent followers of the Songun idea, the most reliable defenders and creditable implementers of the idea. This fully represents the intention of the Party to develop the People's Army into the vanguard ranks protecting the headquarters of the revolution in the van.\r\n The People's Army is the army of the Party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The supreme mission of the People's Army as a driving force for revolution is to devotedly defend the leader. The worth of its existence would be unthinkable without the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA, the devoted protector of the leader, can strikingly demonstrate its mettle to win sure victory only when it implements to the letter the militant tasks laid down in the joint slogans. \r\n The joint slogans clearly indicate ways of strengthening the People's Army into invincible revolutionary armed forces and firmly defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint slogans include slogans calling upon all the servicepersons to prepare themselves as a-match-for-a hundred fighters, establish the steel-like military discipline throughout the army and significantly improve the appearance of the army as regular forces and give the fullest play to the mettle of the army so as to mete out severe and merciless punishment to the aggressors and the provokers in hearty response to the WPK's training-first policy. These slogans serve as a militant banner which the army should always hold aloft for increasing its combat capability. The thorough implementation of the joint slogans would help bolster the revolutionary armed forces.\r\n The People's Army is fully prepared as invincible armed forces capable of firmly protecting the sovereignty of the country and the nation. Unshakable is the determination of the army to shatter any provocations of the enemies and firmly protect the sovereignty of the country and the happiness of the people. \r\n The KPA will thoroughly implement the militant tasks laid down in the joint slogans to powerfully demonstrate the might of the invincible revolutionary armed forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Vigilance against U.S. Attempt for Preemptive Nuclear Attack Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 21 (KCNA) -- A draft \"doctrine for joint nuclear operation\" was made public by the U.S. Department of Defense on Sept. 10. According to it, the field U.S. army commanders may request the U.S. president to allow the use of nuclear weapons in different \"emergency cases\" for mounting a preemptive attack on \"enemy's\" weapons of mass destruction, countering dangerous conventional weapons, putting an early end to war and the like. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed commentary. \r\nThe U.S. intention to amend the doctrine under the pretext of what it calls \"emergency\" is a dangerous attempt to drastically widen the scope of using nuclear weapons and extremely reduce its limit and thus justify its preemptive use of nuclear weapons in any region and country in case of considering it necessary, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is intended to trample down with nuke upon those anti-U.S. independent countries which stand firm against its pressure and threat. It is the U.S. stereotype trick to accuse those countries disobedient to its words of \"keeping weapons of mass destruction and \"developing biological and chemical weapons\" and make a military attack at random under this pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is all the more serious is that the first target of the doctrine is none other than the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the ulterior intention of the U.S. talking about settlement of the nuclear issue through dialogue under the pretext of the six-party talks. In a word, it is to disarm the DPRK and stifle it with nuke. The U.S. attempt to amend the doctrine is a climax of its open nuclear threat and moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the DPRK stands squarely against any U.S. nuclear threat. It is fully ready to decisively control a preemptive nuclear attack with a strong retaliatory blow even if the U.S. commits it any moment. The DPRK is proud to see how wise it was that it has strengthened all its deterrent force in line with the Songun policy to cope with the U.S. moves for a nuclear preemptive attack against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot remain indifferent towards the U.S. attempt at a preemptive nuclear attack and will steadily strengthen its war deterrent to defend national sovereignty and security with supreme vigilance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
