Kim Jong Il's history is precisely the revolutionary history of the President and vice versa.\r\n   Kim Jong Il and the President led the revolution together for as many years as over 30 years.\r\n   All affairs of the revolution and construction should be done as the President planned, intended and did in practice. Herein lies a way of exalting his revolutionary history on this land. All the party members and other working people should uphold the ideas and guidance of Kim Jong Il with a single heart of loyalty and filial piety to complete the Juche revolution.\r\n   Minju Joson calls for holding the President in high esteem and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, under Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n"

Young people had no way of going on to a college or a professional school.\r\n   Considerate of the actual condition,  President Kim Il Sung put forward a policy of giving priority to the education and wisely led the efforts for its implementation.\r\n   The three-year war soon after the liberation destroyed everything in Korea.    However, the state laid foundations for free education in a short period after the war and introduced the universal compulsory primary education system in 1956,  the universal compulsory secondry education in 1958 and the compulsory 9-year technical education in 1967.  \r\n   The universal compulsory 11-year education system has been enforced from 1975 and the introduction of compulsory higher education is now  in preparation.\r\n   a quarter of the population are studying at over 11,000 schools at all levels and hundreds of universities and colleges in different parts of the country.\r\n   The educational work has been ensured by the universal free education system. Social education of different forms, to say nothing of school education, is given free of charge. And stipends are paid to college and university students.\r\n   Thanks to the Juche-based educational and popular policies, the number of intellectuals has reached more than 1,800,000 in the country.    \r\n\r\n"
