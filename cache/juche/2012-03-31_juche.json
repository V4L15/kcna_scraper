But it responded to the DPRK's planned satellite launch with the announcement to stop following through on its commitment to food aid. This would be a regrettable act of scrapping the DPRK-U.S. agreement in its entirety as it is a violation of the core articles of the February 29 DPRK-U.S. agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK extended invitation to satellite experts to visit the launching station to show the sincerity of the DPRK as regards the peaceful satellite launch in a transparent manner. But the U.S. clarified that it would not send its experts and also forced other countries not to send one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis stands in sharp contrast to its previous insistence that the DPRK should accept inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the transparency of its nuclear activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat the U.S. fears is the objective confirmation of the peaceful nature of the DPRK's satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has its own political and military objective in describing the DPRK's satellite launch as a long-range missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy describing the DPRK's \"long-range missile capabilities\" as a \"threat to the U.S. mainland\", the U.S. seeks to justify its missile defense system, which is opposed by all the countries in Northeast Asia, and use it as a pretext for pressing forward the MD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe path chosen by the U.S. would harass peace and stability in Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula and spark off fresh cold war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has not yet reached such a point as to discuss the severity and gravity of the consequences to be entailed by the U.S. wrong option.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt just hopes that the U.S. would courageously accept peaceful satellite launch by a sovereign state, though belatedly, and prove in practice its words that it has no hostility toward the DPRK."

The story is nothing but a version of the fiction about the \"change of system\".\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch rubbish as \"period of power transition\" and \"instability of system\" can never work in the DPRK where the army and the people are dynamically advancing, rallied close around the supreme leader, Minju Joson Saturday says in a bylined commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Instability of system\" is being created in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven at this hour people from all walks of life are courageously turning out in the actions against Lee Myung Bak in south Korea. To make matters worse, a factional strife is getting fierce within the group of traitors in the run-up to the \"National Assembly\" election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis group, thrown into a predicament at home and abroad, is impudent enough to talk about \" instability of system,\" distorting and slandering the reality of the DPRK demonstrating before the whole world the single-minded unity more powerful than a nuclear bomb. This is no more than a political caricature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe aim sought by the group in floating the story about \"instability of north's system\" is to mislead the public opinion in a bid to divert elsewhere the people's criticism of it and tide over the ruling crisis and escalate the confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as the group of traitors hell-bent on the confrontation between the two differing systems is allowed to stay in power, the nation can never escape from misfortune. As a rabid dog should be beaten to death with a stick, the group of traitors should be wiped out as it is engrossed in acts going against the people's mindset. This is the will of all the Koreans."
