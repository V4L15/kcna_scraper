This is an act of destroying the\r\ncradle of the residents in Phyongthaek and seriously threatening the peace on the Korean Peninsula as the real intention of the U.S. forces relocation is to mount a preemptive attack on the north, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They declared that residents in Phyongthaek and civic and public organizations formed the Phyongthaek all-people measure committee to check the south Korea-U.S. unreasonable attempt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants marched toward the U.S. military base, shouting \"We will not yield even single phyong of land cultivated by the sweat of our brow to the U.S.\" and other slogans with placards opposing the expansion of the U.S. military base in hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They held the 186th candlelight rally for checking the expansion of the U.S. military base around the K-6 U.S. military base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the rally demanded the total withdrawal of the U.S. forces, chanting the slogan \"No expansion of U.S. military base\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is also pushing forward the deployment of two latest Aegis destroyers in its military bases in Japan.\r\n The reality indicates that the U.S. has no willingness to co-exist with the DPRK but seeks to \"bring down\" its system by force of arms only, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warhawks defined the DPRK as an \"outpost of tyranny\" after designating it as part of an \"axis of evil\", which was prompted by their heinous aggressive policy to topple the independent country, come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are becoming evermore undisguised in their ambition to stifle Korean style socialism centred on the popular masses, the life and soul of the Korean people and their cradle, by force of arms and dominate the whole of Korea, and its danger is growing day by day. Under such situation the army and the people in the DPRK are interpreting with vigilance the U.S. warhawks' remarks that they will neither attack nor invade north Korea as camouflaged peace rhetoric and a crafty move to disarm and stifle it with ease and stepping up the thorough political, ideological and military preparations to cope with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. to roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK is the only way of averting a catastrophic war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to discontinue its reckless military actions to threaten and invade the DPRK, abandon its hostile policy toward the latter and thus show its will to co-exist with the latter in practice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kumgang, a picturesque mountain of Korea, to implement the June 15 joint declaration and its first meeting was held, at which an inaugural declaration and a joint press release were adopted.\r\n The preparatory committee is a permanent nationwide solidarity organization of the reunification movement which groups  political parties, organizations and public figures of all circles in the north, the south and abroad, the first of its kind ever since the division of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The formation of the committee is a national historic event making it possible to pave a wide avenue of national reconciliation, cooperation, peace and reunification, regardless of differences in idea and ideology, political view, religious belief, class and social stratum, political affiliation and region, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Declaring that the people in the northern half of Korea warmly support the formation of the preparatory committee, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was agreed upon at the first meeting of the preparatory committee to hold grand reunification functions and meetings of organizations of all strata for reunification on significant occasions. This is a judicious option to orient the minds and strength of the fellow countrymen to the successful fulfillment of national historic tasks facing them this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic mission of the preparatory committee in the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration is to closely unite all the fellow countrymen under the banner of the joint declaration and pave a broad way of reunification, placing the common interests of the nation before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and abroad should accept the spirit of the preparatory committee, which raised the anchor for reunification and patriotism, as the requirement of national history and turn out on a nationwide scale in the struggle for reunification and patriotism and thus give full play to the patriotic spirit and invincible might of the Korean nation creating a new history of national unity and a new era of independence and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Some time ago they manufactured a large-sized oxygen separator and constructed minor power stations, dwelling houses, lodging house, cultural house, duck farm, underground refrigerator, etc. in different parts of the complex. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The workers across the country, following their example, turned out as one in carrying out many large projects including the Kwangmyongsong Saltern, Youth Hero Motorway, large-scale land-rezoning and natural-flow waterway. \r\n Such a thing can be done only in the DPRK where the leader trust in and deeply love the people, while the people, closely united in mind, deeply revere the WPK and the leader.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
