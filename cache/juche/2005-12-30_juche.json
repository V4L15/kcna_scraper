This concentrically shows his indefatigable revolutionary activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Infinitely inspired by the devotion of Kim Jong Il, the whole Party, the whole army and the entire people made signal successes in all fields, political, military, economic and cultural, and thus celebrated the 60th birthday of the WPK as a grand festival of victors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons launched a campaign to follow the example of O Jung Hup-led Seventh Regiment which safeguarded President Kim Il Sung at the cost of lives during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, preparing themselves as stalwarts defending the leader with their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMeanwhile, giant successes were registered in the economic sectors, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dam of the Nyongwon Power Station and the Paekma-Cholsan Waterway, gravity-fed irrigation system, were built as monumental edifices in the Songun era and the Taean Friendship Glass Factory, the symbol of the Korea-China friendship, was commissioned with success. And more than 130 objects have been built or reconstructed on an expansion basis and over 8,500 inventions introduced into production. And over 1,600 industrial establishments carried out their yearly plans ahead of schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the military parade, torch procession and grand gymnastic and artistic performance \"Arirang\", which were held in celebration of the 60th birthday of the WPK, fully demonstrated how strongly the army and people are rallied behind Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the successes made by the single-minded unity show the unswerving will of the servicepersons and people to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation without fail in any adversities, rallied close around the leader.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

This is clearly proved by the cases of illegal wiretapping perpetrated by the Security Planning Board which sparked a big furor in south Korea for the past several months since July.\r\n The GNP group has kicked off quite a row while dastardly pulling up others instead of admitting and apologizing for the scandal since it was disclosed.\r\n The predecessors of the GNP resorted to such illegal wiretapping to fake up cases for suppressing those people and its political rivals that stood for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true aim sought by the GNP is to keep the crimes it has committed buried into oblivion and come to power again at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to probe the truth behind every crime committed by GNP and sternly punish the criminals on behalf of the nation irrespective of the statute of limitations in order to prevent the dark era of fascism from coming to south Korea again, improve the inter-Korean relations by the concerted efforts of the Koreans and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n The U.S. has pursued its foreign policy this year as a lever for modern-type aggression and domination, a combination of carrot and stick for putting the world under its domination and control, holding olive branches in the one hand and a whip in the other, the article notes. Citing facts to prove this, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year, in particular, the U.S. imperialists have resorted to the desperate moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neo-conservative forces busied themselves to expand the \"anti-terrorist war\" while vociferating about \"the spread of democracy\" with the appearance of the second-term Bush administration as a momentum, but they could not hold in check the onward movement of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. call for an \"end to tyranny\" was unanimously denounced and rejected by the world for its reactionary nature and aggressive nature, rendering it further isolated worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year various countries tended to shun military assistance to the U.S., standing against its policies of supremacy and high-handed practices. This threw Washington into a tighter corner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the U.S. imperialists were rebuffed and condemned as morally vulgar and worst rogue state in the world as they committed violence, terrorism and bestial human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. belligerent ruling forces singled out \"an end to tyranny\" and \"worldwide spread of freedom and democracy\" as the general goal of their foreign policy this year and have made desperate efforts to attain it. But they have faced the worst political crisis and isolation since they came to power. This irrefutably proves that the U.S. policy of hegemony and \"anti-terrorist strategy\" have gone bankrupt and their doom is inevitable. \r\n The U.S. had better draw a serious lesson from this and stop such criminal moves at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only when the Korean nation invariably upholds the banner of national independence and cooperation can it win victory in confrontation with the diabolic foreign forces and accomplish the cause of national independence and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal moves of the U.S. imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK and stamp out the Korean nation's cause of independence and reunification will be more vicious. But this is a last-ditch effort of those who are scared by the struggle of the Korean nation aspiring after anti-U.S. independence and cooperating close with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will more vigorously wage a just and patriotic struggle to force the U.S. imperialist aggression troops out of south Korea and achieve the cause of independence and reunification, holding fast to national independence and cooperation as a powerful weapon of struggle against the foreign forces.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Great leaping advances were made in all fields of the building of a great prosperous powerful nation as all the servicepersons and people formed ranks with one thought and purpose, their hearts burning with the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution and an integral whole based on the sense of moral obligation who shares the same destiny out of revolutionary comradeship.\r\n It is high pride of Kim Il Sung's nation that they made this year a year of single-minded unity to shine long in the history of the country.\r\n This year was, at the same time, a significant one in which the country's military power was augmented in every way through the thorough implementation of the WPK's Songun revolutionary line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il, the political and military might of the Korean People's Army grew stronger than ever before in the course of the general advance of revolution this year. Prevailing throughout the army are the revolutionary commanding system and military discipline whereby all the servicepersons move as one according to the order of the supreme commander. And all of them have been trained as soldiers of Ri Su Bok and Kim Kwang Chol type in the 21st century who, replete with ardent patriotism and revolutionary comradeship, are ready to dedicate themselves to the only motherland without hesitation. They conducted intensive combat and political training to smash the moves of any formidable enemy for aggression at one stroke, thereby emerging a-match-for-a hundred revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu. This might of the KPA greatly inspired the Korean people in their general advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A great leap forward and signal innovations were brought about in the socialist economic construction and in the efforts to improve the standard of people's living this year through the drive to effect a great surge in the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shining victory and successes achieved by the army and people in their general advance of Songun revolution this year are the fruition of the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. The great achievements made in the general advance this year help them keenly realize the clear-sighted leadership he has provided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having glorified this year as a year of great change to be always recorded in the history of the WPK and the country, the servicepersons and people of the DPRK are now firmly determined to steadily advance to uninterruptedly create a history of shining victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
