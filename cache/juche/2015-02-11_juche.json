            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Construction Sites in Wonsan City\r\n Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, provided field guidance to the construction sites of baby Home, orphanage and orphans' primary and secondary schools in Wonsan City.\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the construction sites, he learned in detail about the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the baby home, orphanage and orphans' primary and secondary schools are being built along one line and construction of nursing and educational establishments for orphans this way will help them finish the whole course from nursery to secondary school without any inconvenience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is an unshakable resolution of our party to bring up all the orphans as excellent pillars of the country, he said, giving an instruction to push forward the constriction projects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction to dynamically conduct frontline-style political work including visual and broadcasting agitations and art squad activities and energetically wage a socialist emulation among units, at different stages and among construction projects so as to bring about great innovations and leap forward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to pay deep attention to ensuring the quality of structure, he said it is necessary to strengthen supervision and control so that builders may thoroughly meet the requirements of designs and construction methods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is possible to step up construction projects only when building materials including structural steel and cement are satisfactorily supplied, he took measures for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underlining the need to arrange well the environment of the baby home, orphanage and orphans' primary and secondary schools, he called for planting lots of trees in the mountain and field near them so that they may be thick with foliage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the construction and preparations for operation should be pushed forward simultaneously, underscoring the need to produce furniture, household utensils and other school things required for the operation of the baby home, orphanage and orphans' primary and secondary schools and step up, at the same time, the work for making uniforms for nurses and kindergarten teachers at the best level and the work for selecting management members and preparing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Recalling that the party sent a standard design for nursing and educational establishments for orphans to every province, he stressed that the relevant areas should wage a dynamic drive for building baby homes, orphanages, orphan's primary and secondary schools to suit the features of their areas, give prominence to their appearance and to be in line with their environment and accommodating capacity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called upon every province to build up the forces for designing and construction and lay solid material and technical foundations in order to thoroughly implement the party's construction policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the construction site, I feel once again that the party's plan is being successfully translated into reality wherever service personnel work, he noted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly praised service personnel of KPA Navy Unit 863 for having wound up the frame project of the baby home though they had no experience in construction. They could do this because they had waged a devoted struggle as the standard-bearer and a model in implementing the ideas of the party and upholding its policies, under the slogan \"Let the People's Army take charge of both national defence and socialist construction!\", he said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a great pity for failing to meet soldiers of the unit as they are on training to carry out a fresh order, he said. He asked officials to tell them that the supreme commander was very pleased to look round their construction site and convey his militant salute to them without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the People's Army to get more forces involved in the construction so as to complete the construction of the baby home and orphanage in Wonsan City till the Day of the Sun and construction of the orphan's primary and secondary schools till the day of war victory this year marking the 70th founding anniversary of the WPK.     He called on the People's Army to ensure the best quality in construction so that they may take responsibility for the safety of the projects and guarantee their absolute quality for all eternity and thus provide good cradle to the orphans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief and conviction that the soldier-builders would complete the construction of the baby home, orphanage and orphan's primary and secondary schools in Wonsan City by joining efforts with people in Kangwon Province and thus uphold in practice the intention of the party to bring up the orphans as reliable heirs to the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Hwang Pyong So, Hyon Yong Chol, Han Kwang Sang and Jo Yong Won."

Korean Authorities' Policy of Toeing U.S. Policy Will Lead to Miserable End: CPRK Special Statement\r\n Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released a special statement on Wednesday clarifying the stand of the DPRK in connection with the grave situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula due to the south Korean authorities' anachronistic policy of toeing the U.S. line.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The south Korean authorities will not be able to escape the most miserable end if they persistently join the U.S. moves for a war of aggression aimed to disturb peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has so far advanced the most reasonable and realistic proposals for the peaceful reunification and made consistent efforts for their materialization. It was not because it did not know other means and ways of achieving reunification nor it lacked muscle and ability to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not want the Korean peninsula to suffer another war disaster. We have bolstered up the military capacity in every way despite stern test of history. It was aimed to avert the U.S. war of aggression and protect the destiny of the nation. The DPRK's access to smaller, precision and diversified nuclear strike means was designed to conclude the final battle with the U.S. in its mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But we do not hide that if the south Korean warmongers offer cannon fodder for U.S. war of aggression against the DPRK, south Korea will also be the target of our retaliatory strikes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aggressors and provokers are bound to die and we are sure to survive. This is our faith and the philosophy of sure victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. If the south Korean authorities persistently pursue international \"cooperation\" aimed to put pressure on the DPRK and bring it down, they will not escape the most shameful destruction. Those who want to add to their crimes, acting a shock brigade in the U.S. \"international cooperation\" in utter disregard of national dignity and interests will never be able to escape unheard-of toughest counteraction declared by the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The south Korean authorities will face stern trial by the nation as the most hideous confrontational maniacs if they work hard to turn the north-south relations into scapegoat of U.S.-south Korea master-servant relationship under the deceptive signboard of \"dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe made a bold decision to treat the south Korean ruling quarters as a dialogue partner and settle north-south relations with them even though they were steeped in sycophancy and submission to the U.S.  to the marrow of their bones. This was to create an opportunity of doing good things for the nation on such an important occasion as this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not talk about \"change in attitude\" of others but opt for fundamentally settling the north-south relations from a proper attitude toward the fellow countrymen, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clearly understand that their submission to the U.S. would bring them only the most miserable end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should turn out in the sacred and patriotic struggle to resolutely foil the U.S. moves to stem the gigantic trend toward Korea's reunification and frustrate the south Korean puppet forces' acts of treachery, and usher in a new era of peace, stability, independent reunification and prosperity on the Korean peninsula."

Tomiichi Murayama who was prime minister of Japan in August 1995 said in a speech that he admitted Japan took the road of aggression and war by enforcing the wrong state policy in the past, and vowed not to make the past wrongdoings again by seriously reflecting on the lesson of history and informing the rising generations of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of Japan wants to delete from his new \"statement\" such core expressions as \"colonial rule\", \"aggression\" and \"apology\" that were contained in \"Murayama statement\" which admitted and reflected on Japan's past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Wednesday in a commentary terms this an undisguised challenge and mockery of not only the Korean nation which suffered bitter pain due to Japan but also those countries that suffered damage and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The attempt of Japan's chief executive to deny \"Murayama statement\" is, in essence, a revelation of his open willingness to make Japan follow in the footsteps of the predecessors who committed crimes in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can Japan justify its criminal attempt."

Si las autoridades surcoreanas se incorporan a la guerra de agresion de Estados Unidos que pretende perturbar la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y exterminar a la RPDC, no podran eludir el fin mas tragico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta ahora, hemos presentado los proyectos mas racionales y realistas para la reunificacion pacifica y realizado constantes esfuerzos por ponerlos en practica, aunque conocemos otros medios y metodos de reunificacion y tenemos la fuerza y capacidad de lograrla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo deseamos que la Peninsula Coreana sufra otra vez los desastres de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHemos consolidado por todos los medios la capacidad militar superando las severas pruebas de la historia para prevenir la guerra de agresion de EE.UU. y defender el destino de la nacion. Y ahora contamos con los medios de ataque nuclear minimizados, precisos y diversificados con el fin de terminar en el territorio estadounidense la batalla decisiva contra EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no ocultamos que el Sur de Corea tambien sera el blanco de nuestro ataque de venganza si los belicistas surcoreanos se ofrecen como carnes de canon de la guerra de agresion de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTenemos la conviccion y la filosofia de victoria de que venceremos vivos en el combate contra los agresores y provocadores que moriran. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Si las autoridades surcoreanas siguen recurriendo a la \"colaboracion\" internacional encaminada a presionar y derrumbar a la RPDC, sufriran el arruinamiento mas vergonzoso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los que abultan su expediente criminal actuando como brigada de choque de la campana de \"colaboracion internacional\" de EE.UU., sin tomar en cuenta la dignidad ni los intereses de la nacion, no podran eludir el destino tragico en la batalla intransigente sin precedentes, proclamada por la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Si las autoridades surcoreanas intentan convertir los vinculos Norte-Sur en los sujetos a las relaciones con EE.UU. bajo el enganoso cartel de \"dialogo\", seran condenadas por toda la nacion como maniacos conflictivos de peor calana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHemos tomado la decision de resolver con magnanimidad las relaciones intercoreanas mediante el dialogo tratando a los gobernantes surcoreanos como contraparte, aunque ellos estan colmados de la conciencia servil a EE.UU. Es que asi quisimos darles la oportunidad de hacer favores para la nacion en el tiempo importante como este ano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben tener correcta actitud sobre la parte connacional y dirigirse a resolver radicalmente los vinculos Norte-Sur, en lugar de hablar del \"cambio de actitud\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben conocer que el servilismo proyanqui les traera el fin mas tragico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los integrantes de la nacion coreana en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar deben frustrar las maniobras de EE.UU. destinadas a detener la corriente de reunificacion de Corea y  los actos traidores y vendepatrias de los titeres surcoreanos que obedecen a ciegas al imperio norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHan de levantarse como un solo hombre en la sagrada lucha patriotica por abrir la nueva era de paz, estabilidad, reunificacion independiente y prosperidad de la Peninsula Coreana."
