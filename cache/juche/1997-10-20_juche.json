They dare to announce that the weapons will be used to attack the DPRK and Mid-East countries.\r\n   Some time ago, the U.S. military magazine defense news reported that the U.S. army and navy are jointly developing a missile capable of destroying the underground concrete structures in the DPRK and Mid-East countries.\r\n   The United States recently sent flagships of seventh and fifth fleets to surroundings of the Korean Peninsula, timed to coincide with the announcement of the new \"Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines\", which is a war scenario to cope with \"contingency in the Korean Peninsula\".\r\n   Such ill-boding moves show once again that the U.S. still seeks an anachronistic, imperialist and dominationist design, challenging the aspiration of humankind for peace and progress today on the eve of the 21st century, and that its talkative \"peace\" is hypocrisy.\r\n   Especially, the facts are logically contrary to their argument that they will discuss through the \"four-party talks\" the issue of peace on the Korean Peninsula. They also lay obstacles in the way of its solution, making us doubt about the U.S. administration's promises in its Korea policy.\r\n   The U.S. military's reckless arms buildup and war moves deprive the U.S. of any qualification and ground to clamour about the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" and \"missile issue.\"\r\n   Choice for defence is an inalienable right of every nation and every sovereign state, not monopolized by the U.S. \r\n   The Korean people and army will certainly exercise their legitimate rights to cope with such war moves. \r\n\r\n"

The ground color of the cloud of big parachute type was white and its rims were dyed with seven colors.\r\n   It was all the more wonderful that the cloud stayed low above Hyangdo Peak for a long time before moving toward Janggun Peak. The moment, mysterious sounds reminiscent of cheers and applause came from surface of Lake Chon and a strong whirlwind rose which carried piles of snow into the sky and dropped them onto the ground, adorning the sky on Mt. Paektu in various colors.\r\n   Witnessing these wonderful natural phenomena, its inhabitants said that nature also celebrated Kim Jong Il's election as WPK General Secretary. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
