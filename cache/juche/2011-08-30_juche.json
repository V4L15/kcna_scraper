He extended the special thanks of the Supreme Commander of the KPA to all the soldier builders and bestowed benevolence upon them with his loving care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe noted that the builders of the Huichon Power Station are, indeed, the frontline fighters defending the Central Committee of the WPK with human bullets and bombs, not in words only, and they are the first-line standard-bearers in the era of great surge who are taking the lead in the drive to usher in a day of the appearance of a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe shining exploits being performed in the building of the Huichon Power Station are a striking demonstration of the inexhaustible mental power of the army and people of the DPRK and the tremendous potential of the independent national economy and, at the same time, another shining victory won by them in the struggle for resolutely smashing the vicious moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries to isolate and stifle the DPRK and safeguarding and glorifying Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe WPK determined to finish in a matter of three years the Huichon Power Station equal to the large nature-harnessing work which no others could ever image as it believed in the indomitable mental power of the army and the people, he said, noting with pride that the construction of the Huichon Power Station goes to clearly prove that Korean-style socialism is, indeed, the best in the world and there is nothing impossible in the world as long as the army and people of the DPRK display their inexhaustible strength. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching the letters \"At one go\" inscribed on granite, he said that when reading those letters in the distant future, the younger generation will know well about the ideological and moral traits and fighting spirit of the servicepersons of the KPA who devotedly implemented the combat order of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnits of the KPA are successfully playing the role as vanguard and shock brigade on the Huichon front, too, he said, adding that the admirable feats performed by the soldiers while devoting their all to the prosperity of the country and the happiness of posterity will go down long in the history of the building of a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter going round the construction site of the Huichon Power Station, he put forth on the spot important tasks to satisfactorily settle the problem of electricity including the construction of the power station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe construction of the hydropower station is an important work to carry out the instructions of President Kim Il Sung and to settle the electricity shortage is the most primary task for the building of a thriving nation, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the consistent policy of the WPK to build large-scale and minor hydropower stations in a big way, he said, underlining the need to continue paying primary attention to this matter in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNot a long period is left till 2012, the centenary of birth of the President, he said, calling for making great innovations and leaping forward in each worksite of the socialist front, thus showing the world what great miracles the army and people of the DPRK are working while dashing ahead like the wind toward an invincible great power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe had a photo session with the soldier builders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, KPA Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and chief of the General Staff of the KPA, KPA Vice Marshal Kim Yong Chun, member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and minister of the People's Armed Forces, Jang  Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice-chairman of the NDC, KPA General Kim Jong Gak, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and first vice director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Pak To Chun and Thae Jong Su, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, Ri Myong Su, minister of People's Security, and KPA Generals Kim Won Hong and Hyon Chol  Hae."
