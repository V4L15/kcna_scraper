            "content": "Japan's dangerous military move under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, chief cabinet secretary of Japan Fukuda addressing the ad hoc committee of the House of Representatives to cope with the \"event of armed attack\" expressed his will to work for the adoption of a new law on establishing a \"civilian defence organization.\"\r\n This was prompted by a criminal intention of the Japanese reactionaries to convert Japan into a military power and realize their ambition to launch overseas expansion, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that the issue of adopting a \"law on emergency\" and the issue of establishing the \"civilian defence organization\" are under formal debate at the diet at a time when Japan is trying to keep warships of the Japan \"self-defence forces\" in the Indian Ocean for another six months in a bid to carry on a joint operation with the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This suggests that the Japanese reactionaries' preparations for a war of aggression to convert Japan into a military power and realize their ambition for overseas expansion are close to completion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist forces which have been under the mask of \"peace\" since its defeat are coming out to launch a war of reconquest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to behave with discretion, keeping in mind that their attempt is as foolish an act as trying to jump into a fire with faggot on their backs.     \r\n\r\n"
