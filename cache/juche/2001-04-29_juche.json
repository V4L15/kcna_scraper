It is our high\r\n pride to have such excellent youth with great mental power, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also noted that creators and artistes of the Korean Film Studio have produced many films of high ideological and artistic value over the past years, true to the party's line and policy on the Juche-oriented literature and art, thus educating the party members and other working people in the revolutionary idea and strongly encouraging them in the revolution and construction. And he expressed the expectation and belief that they would bring about a continued upswing in the production of revolutionary films. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Statement of spokesman for GFTUK central committee \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- A May Day pro-reunification meeting of workers from the north and the south of Korea, the first of its kind since the division of the country, is slated to be held on Mt. Kumgang. But, the South Korean authorities have groundlessly refused to allow Ri Kyu Jae, vice-chairman of the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and concurrently chairman of its reunification committee to participate in the meeting as a head of the south side's delegation.\r\n In this regard, a spokesman for the central committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea released a statement on Saturday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Kyu Jae has stood in the van of the reunification movement. But the South Korean authorities' refusal came at a time when the whole world hopes that a new phase will be opened for Korea's reunification through an early implementation of the June 15 Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This throws an obstacle to the successful opening of the meeting and challenges the just movement of all the workers and pro-reunification patriots in the south to implement the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GFTUK central committee strongly denounces this unjustifiable behavior as an unpardonable act intended to lay a hurdle in the way of the righteous struggle of all the workers in the north and the south for national reunification under the banner of the joint declaration and put the brake on its impementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities are again groundlessly accusing him of violating the \"National Security Law\". This is evidently intended to foil the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should withdraw the unreasonable refusal and provide all conditions for all the delegates of the south side to attend the meeting for supporting and implementing the joint declaration, unhindered.    \r\n\r\n"

It is our stand that the north and the south of Korea should materialise disarmament in the process of going toward reunification, providing that the U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only after the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, the prime mover of war against the north threatening the security of the nation and the peace of the country, withdraw from South Korea, can disarmament in the north and the south be brought up for discussion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, forces for northward invasion, are the root cause which sparks arms race and brings the danger of war in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now South Korea has become a powder magazine of the most dangerous nuclear war. The DPRK has been exposed to constant threat of aggression due to the U.S. imperialists policy of aggression on Korea and its moves to ignite a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, the Bush administration's hegemonism and hostile policy toward the DPRK bring the aggressive nature of the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea into bolder relief and renders the situation more dangerous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For disarmament on the Korean peninsula the U.S. troops, the root cause of aggression and war, should withdraw from South Korea and the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea should be stopped. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brigandish demand for \"reduction of conventional weapons\" in the DPRK can never go down with us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is really interested in disarmament on the Korean peninsula, first  of all, it should pull its aggression troops out of South Korea. Then the disarmament of the Korean peninsula will come true of itself.    \r\n\r\n"
