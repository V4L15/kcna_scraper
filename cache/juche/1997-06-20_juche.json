Speeches were made by youth and students at the rally.\r\n   The speakers said that all the youth and students in the northern half of Korea will stand on the side of the students of south Korea undauntedly struggling for reunification and patriotism at all times and extend full support and encouragement to the struggle of \"Hanchongryon\".\r\n   A letter of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League Central Committee to International Youth and Student Organizations was read out at the rally.\r\n   Referring to the Kim Young Sam group's moves to crack down on and stifle \"Hanchongryon\", the letter said:\r\n   In a bid to justify the hair-raising suppression of \"Hanchongryon\", the south Korean authorities charged that south Korean students' determination to take part in the 14th World Festival of Youth and Students at the Inaugural Ceremony of \"Hanchongryon\" is an \"enemy-benefitting act to attend an assembly of young people of communist states\".\r\n   If the south Korean authorities' move to disorganize \"Hanchongryon\" is not checked up, it will bring a grave danger to the movement of the south Korean youth and students aspiring after justice and progress and, at the same time, exert a great loss upon the development of the democratic movement of world youth and students.\r\n   The central committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League expresses the belief that your organizations will pay due attention to the serious situation prevailing in south Korea and take effective steps to check up the south Korean authorities' manoeuvres for crack down on the students' movement and extend solidarity for \"Hanchongryon's\" just struggle. \r\n\r\n"
