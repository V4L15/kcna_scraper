            "content": "Political Murder by Traitorous Party \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- The death of Jong Mong Hon is a political murder committed by the Grand National Party of south Korea displeased with the development of the inter-Korean relations, declares Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today.\r\n Recalling that Jong made significant contributions to promoting the co-prosperity and common interests of the nation as a pioneer of the work for reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south, it says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP, hating the normal economic relations between the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) and the Hyundai Asan of south Korea, has run the whole gamut of vicious obstructions to block them. And, in the long run, it framed up a ridiculous \"law on special inspection\" to block them altogether and continued putting pressure on chairman of the Hyundai Asan Jong Mong Hon, the leading figure of Hyundai. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For a few days before his tragic death, he had been subjected to questioning accompanied by threats and blackmail for 10-12 hours a day several times. When he was staying in Mt. Kumgang from July 23 to 25 for negotiations on inter-Korean economic cooperation, he told the vice-chairman of the KAPPC and those concerned of the north side with deep anger that not only the Hyundai Asan but all the political and financial circles of south Korea \"will be barred from normal activities\" before the \"special inspection comes to an end\" and \"history will settle account with those who enacted the 'law on special inspection' in the future.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sword of \"special inspection\" directed against him drove him to an unbearable state where he had to choose the tragic death. It is an obvious murder and the GNP is to blame for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no subterfuge can the GNP escape from the responsibility for having driven to death Jong Mong Hon who had greatly contributed to national reconciliation and unity and the cause of reunification. The GNP must be buried underground at an early date for the sake of the democratic development of the south Korean society, the inter-Korean relations and national reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

We should wage an active struggle against the U.S. war moves, closely united under the banner of the June 15 Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should renounce its hostile policy toward the north, drop its plan to invade it, conclude a non-aggression treaty with it and replace the armistice agreement with a durable peace agreement.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Dismisses U.S. Plan to Contain DPRK with Nukes Daydream \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- 58 years have passed since the U.S. dropped A-bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, causing the first nuclear disaster in history.\r\n During this period humankind has waged a strenuous anti-nuke struggle to build a free and peaceful world without any nuclear weapons but the desire has not yet come true because the U.S. has challenged the global peace and security and sparked a global nuclear arms race, advocating the \"theory of all-powerful nuclear weapon\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dropped the first a-bomb over Hiroshima from B-29 on August 6, 1945 and the second one over Nagasaki three days later, thus becoming the first criminal to use A-bombs in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. President Truman before the test of the first A-bomb at 4 a. m. on July 16, 1945 blustered that the explosion of the A-bomb would provide the U.S. with a stick to strike other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not secret that the successive U.S. presidents have kicked off nuclear hysteria, vociferating about the justice and necessity of the use of nuclear weapons over the last more than half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the appearance of the bush administration, the U.S. military strategy made u turn from the hypocritical \"nuclear containment\" strategy to a preemptive nuclear attack strategy, heralding a real nuclear disaster to humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, seized with an anachronistic ambition to dominate the world, made a policy switchover to realize it with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this century the U.S. seeks to realize its strategy of dominating the world with nuclear threat and blackmail, while working hard to maintain an unchallenged nuclear edge to meet the challenge of other powers and prevent the appearance of new rivals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lies the main purpose of the new nuclear strategy pursued by the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plan for nuclear attack aimed at maintaining an unchallenged nuclear edge and seizing major regions of resources and military strategic regions through unlimited military actions for world domination has already entered the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. is steadily increasing the budget related to nuclear weapons and working in real earnest to develop nuclear weapons, reorganize and expand the mechanism for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. defense department has already taken a measure to drastically increase the function of the U.S. strategic command controlling the nuclear armed forces by putting the space command under that command. It decided to push forward the plan to spend 5 billion dollars spread over 10 years for modernizing the facilities producing nuclear weapons across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Congress dominated by the republican party fully agreed to the bush administration's new mode of having access to nuclear weapons, ie a nuclear strategy based on preemptive nuclear attack, and approved of most of the proposals for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the U.S. house of representatives and the senate agreed to spend 15.5 million dollars to develop nuclear bombs for destroying underground structures. The senate decided to repeal the \"law banning smaller nukes\" which was adopted and took effect in 1993. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. made it public that it would channel all efforts into the production of nuclear warheads for various types of missiles in 10 years to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. new nuclear weapon plan now pushed forward under the pretext of coping with bio-chemical and other types of weapons of \"rogue states\" will only result in upsetting the global military strategic balance and stability, spark a nuclear arms race in the world and further increase the danger of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt at a military attack under the pretext of the nuclear issue has gone beyond the limit. As a result, the situation on the Korean peninsula is so grave that the most horrible and destructive nuclear war in history may break out there any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is set not to settle the nuclear issue but further complicate it, driving the situation to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has recently worked out and made public the new nuclear war plan \"operation plan 5030\" to attack the DPRK and is putting into practice the plan for a preemptive attack, while massively deploying more ultra-modern military hardware in and around the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well-known a fact that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for this nuclear issue and it is not the international community but the U.S. which caused the present nuclear crisis in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to the settlement of the nuclear issue, therefore, lies in whether the U.S. is truly willing to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plan to contain the DPRK through a nuclear attack is nothing but a daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to regard the nuclear monopoly and threat as the best leverage to establish world domination. Nothing is more serious mistake than for the U.S. to test its nuclear policy in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the revolutionary resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to return fire for fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ponder over the catastrophic disasters to be brought by its new nuclear strategy.    \r\n\r\n"

And they even outlined ways of provoking a war. Hitting at their war outcries, the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such provocative articles were openly made public in the press at a time when the U.S. has hurled an elite combat unit equipped with latest sophisticated weapons into south Korea to stage war exercises despite the objection of all public circles, this shows what lengths it has gone in its arrogance.    \r\n\r\n"
