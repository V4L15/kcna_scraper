It also calls for taking measures to cope with possible \"rebuff and surprise provocation from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t An article of Rodong Sinmun Sunday describes the puppet forces' desperate moves to put sanctions and pressure on the DPRK as a revelation of their sinister intention to undermine and do harm to the ideology and social system of the DPRK, with the help of outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present puppet ruling forces have to draw a lesson from the miserable fate of their predecessors who met shameful ends while getting keen on escalating confrontation with the fellow countrymen in collusion with outsiders, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak and Park Geun Hye groups of traitors had worked hard to inflict sanctions and pressure on the DPRK with the backing of outsiders till the last moments of their withdrawal from Chongwadae since the first days of their office.

There, he pressurized those African countries to downgrade the level of diplomatic relations with the DPRK and cut off economic relations with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, leading newspapers of the DPRK Sunday brand his act as an expression of the policy of threat and pressure of a rogue state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His brigandish act is a last-ditch effort of those thrown into extreme hopelessness and setback, being unable to find any other way to check the DPRK's measure of increasing the nuclear capabilities to the highest level, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tillerson called on even African countries to cut off all the relations with the DPRK. This is little short of admitting its defeat in the one-to-one nuclear stand-off with the DPRK that has persisted century after century. The U.S. has become so exhausted and fallen on hard times in confrontation with the DPRK that it has now stretched its hands for help even to the African countries which it has so far regarded only as targets of exploitation and plunder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear force of the DPRK is targeted against the U.S. which is working desperate to undermine the sovereignty and rights to existence and development of the DPRK. There is no need whatsoever for the African countries to feel any threat from the nuclear deterrence of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is a country that has instilled those African countries which were moaning under the oppression of colonial rule by the imperialists with the rays of the Juche idea and rendered disinterested aid and assistance to those countries in their struggle for national liberation and building of new society. Those African countries can not harbor any feelings of hostility and grudge against the DPRK. However, the U.S., being unaware of what those African countries think about, is forcing them to implement the UN \"sanctions resolution\" for no reason. The U.S. act can not but be a gangster-like one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says that Tillerson's demand on African countries to \"cut off all relations with north Korea\" only disclosed the shameless and gangster-like nature of the U.S. which pursues only anachronistic hegemonic strategy, while failing to discern the trend of the times."
