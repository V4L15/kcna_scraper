Paektu was a great national event that promised a bright future in carving out the destiny of the Korean people and carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il, a politician of the great President Kim Il Sung type, shouldered upon himself the heavy responsibility of steering the Korean revolution, confidently carrying forward his idea and leadership, and as a result, the Korean people's cause of independence could adorn the victorious history of the Juche-oriented revolution for generations, courageously meeting all challenges of the present world and pulling through manifold difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the whole period of his revolutionary activities Kim Jong Il set forth and successfully applied the most scientific and unique principles and methods guiding the revolution under the uplifted banner of the Juche idea, converting Kim Il Sung's Korea into a political and ideological power which demonstrates its dignity all over the world, a military power which no formidable enemy dares provoke and an invincible country that unswervingly carries forward the cause of independence and prosperity with the might of single-minded unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il developed the traditional unity and cohesion of the revolutionary ranks in the DPRK into the more solid single-minded unity of the leader, the party, the army and the people based on the Songun idea as required by the grave situation where the Korean revolution was facing a crucial phase in which the Korean people had to stand in all-out confrontation with the imperialists on which hinged the destiny of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the outstanding leadership of Kim Jong Il the revolutionary cause of Juche has made a victorious advance and registered unprecedentedly great achievements, promising a bright future of a great prosperous and powerful socialist nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's attainment of the status of a full-fledged nuclear weapons state successfully realized the long-cherished desire of the Korean nation to have matchless national power and made it possible for it to reliably defend the socialist homeland from the enemy's nuclear war threat and aggression and greatly contribute to ensuring peace and security in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The Songun politics, genuine patriotic one, pursued by Kim Jong Il brought about a landmark phase in carrying out the cause of national reunification and ushered in the historic June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called upon all party members, the servicepersons of the KPA and people to devotedly safeguard the headquarters of the revolution politically and ideologically in the transparent spirit of devotedly defending the leader and become staunch fighters and genuine comrades in the Songun revolution who share ideas, intention and destiny with Kim Jong Il on the road of the arduous struggle to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to firmly establish the trait of attaching importance to the military affairs throughout the society and develop the defence industry, improve the standard of people's living and rejuvenate the nation's overall economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation still remains tense and acute on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. invariable hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is going reckless in its moves to tarnish the authority and prestige of the DPRK and strangle it economically by mobilizing its allies including Japan. These moves of the U.S. are accompanied by its escalated appeasement, pressure and sanctions. The DPRK is, therefore, closely following these moves with a high degree of vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons and people of the DPRK will never allow anyone to infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit but steadily increase the political and military potentials under the uplifted banner of the great Songun and thus win a final victory in the confrontation with the U.S. and imperialists and reliably defend the ideology, system and the cause of justice in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Similar meetings took place at units of the KPA three services and in provinces, cities and counties on the same day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They prevented anyone suspected of participating in it from entering the place, creating a terror-ridden atmosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Won Jae, chief of the room for handling the situation of the headquarters, deplored that the action taken by the security authorities self-exposes the injustice of the conclusion of FTA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, a meeting took place at the Posin house in Jongro to vow to intensify the action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was addressed by O Jong Ryol, co-representative of the headquarters, Pak In Suk, executive chairperson of the Democratic Labor Party, Kim Hung Hyon, chairman of the National Federation of the Poor, and others. They called for checking the conclusion of the sycophantic and traitorous FTA without fail as it will call for total concession to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the meeting, its participants staged a surprise protest demonstration, march and other actions against the conclusion of FTA in different parts of Seoul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their actions were followed by a candle-light rally in that evening at which the participants called for carrying on their struggle till the conclusion of FTA has been checked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The headquarters declared that it would stage a collective sit-in struggle and various forms of information services and hold an oath-taking rally of workers, peasants and religionists and other actions in the whole period when the 7th round of the negotiations for the conclusion of FTA would be under way.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
