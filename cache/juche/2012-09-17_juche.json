This is just a ridiculous act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula was produced as the U.S. shipped nuclear weapons into south Korea and posed a threat to the DPRK with nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are becoming all the more reckless in their moves to invade the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is entirely just that the DPRK bolstered the nuclear deterrent for self-defense under the uplifted banner of Songun to cope with the prevailing situation and no one can find fault with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces persist in their hostile acts for provocation and aggression aimed at the DPRK, its nuclear deterrent for self-defense will be further modernized and expanded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one will lend an ear to the rubbish of lunatic Lee Myung Bak whose days are numbered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had better stop his absurd wordplay and get ready for his death."

            "content": "DPRK-Japan Relations Hinge on Japan's Attitude: KCNA Commentary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 17 (KCNA) -- 10 years have passed since the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration was adopted.\n\t\t\t\t\t On September 17, 2002, the top leaders of the DPRK and Japan signed the declaration the main spirit of which is to redeem the inglorious past between the two countries, settle their pending issues and establish fruitful political, economic and cultural relations for the first time in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration serves as a milestone for improving the DPRK-Japan relations as it comprehensively indicates the goal, principles and basic ways for doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The declaration reflects the will of the peoples of the two countries to create a new history of the improved DPRK-Japan relations by liquidating the inglorious past, banning any act of threatening mutual security and cooperating with each other for peace and stability in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government of the DPRK has made every possible effort for successfully implementing the declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Quite contrary to this, Japan misinterpreted and defamed the basic spirit of the declaration from the outset, scuttling the implementation of its every paragraph.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Zealously pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, Japan has not implemented any provision of the declaration but worked in the direction of annulling it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan embellished and justified its history of aggression against Korea in which it imposed unspeakable misfortune and sufferings upon the Korean people including the sexual slavery, violating the provisions calling for redeeming its past crimes, the basic requirement for the implementation of the declaration and prerequisite to the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Persistently pulling up the DPRK over \"its nuclear and missile and abduction issues,\" Japan fanned up the hostility toward the DPRK and stepped up the moves for its militarist expansion in real earnest internally and turned the DPRK-Japan relations more hostile than those before the adoption of the declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the view of Japan that the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and detente are little short of losing the justification for putting into practice its moves for turning itself into a military giant including nuclear weaponization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why Japan threw obstacles in discussing every matter at the six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"missile issue\" touted by Japan is nothing but a pretext for rounding off its preparations for turning itself into a military giant and staging a comeback to Korea as evidenced by its joint efforts with the U.S. to establish the missile defence system and launch spy satellites under the pretext of ensuring peace and security in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly proved by the fact that Japan recently laid a legal foundation for its space militarization and nuclear weaponization, talking about the DPRK's \"missile threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The forces of Japan hostile to the DPRK are persistently raising the already settled \"abduction issue\" and using it for their sinister political purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has persistently concocted fresh \"information about abduction\" though the \"abduction issue\" had been finally settled thanks to the sincere efforts made by the DPRK. It has used this as a principal pretext for concealing its past crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan created \"abduction industry\" rare to be found in any other parts of the world. It set up government organizations and conspiratorial bodies handling the \"abduction issue\" in various places, using them as a lever for winning the popularity of conservative politicians and letting those who deal with the issue earn money. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when one raises a hue and cry over the \"abduction issue\", can one become \"a nationalist\" and \"a patriot\" and do a bit in the political camp. Only ruckus over this matter can help such riff-raffs as the members of \"the Society for Rescuing Abductees\" eke out their living. This is the present situation of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities have intensified their political persecution and suppression of Koreans in Japan and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), a legitimate overseas citizens' organization of the DPRK under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\", mercilessly infringing upon their right to existence and national rights. Their repressive campaign against Koreans in Japan and Chongryon protecting their national rights has reached its height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As all facts prove, the Japanese authorities' racket over the \"nuclear, missile and abduction issues\" pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is nothing but a wanton violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and a move to scrap it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to Japan's vicious policy of confrontation with the DPRK, the declaration has been seriously misinterpreted as the one for settling someone's \"nuclear, missile and abduction issues\" quite contrary to its noble idea and spirit and the prospect of its implementation is becoming grim as the days go by. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK-Japan relations can never be mended if Japan persistently talks about the \"nuclear, missile and abduction issues,\" toeing the U.S. policy, failing to realize the gravity of the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the behest of Generalissimo Kim Jong Il to improve the DPRK-Japan relations so that the two countries may become near and close countries, not near but distant ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government of the DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to implement the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese authorities are truly willing to contribute to the development of the relations between the two countries and peoples and peace and stability in the region, they should roll back their anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and opt for the implementation of the historic declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether the DPRK-Japan relations are normalized in conformity with the expectation of the international community and the wishes of the peoples of the two countries in the new century or remain in the abnormal state of confrontation entirely depends on Japan's attitude."

Not content with this, he flew to a Nordic country where he again trumpeted about \"no nukes and opening\", claiming that \"if the north abandons its nukes and become a member of the international community, the whole world will help it\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that Lee is behaving so foolishly though he is no more than a sleep walker hit hard from all sides, totally rejected by the people and strongly censured at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disgusting remarks made by Lee, ignorant of the essence of the nuclear issue, are no more than the last-ditch efforts of those driven into a tight corner due to the total failure of his policy of confrontation with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula was spawned by the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK and the south Korean puppet group's toeing the U.S. line from A to Z. The U.S. ceaseless nuclear blackmail, deployment of nuclear weapons in south Korea and the reckless maneuvers for a nuclear war staged by it together with south Korean warmongers compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear deterrent for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee has neither justification nor face to talk about the nuclear issue as he has got frantic with those war exercises while dreaming of disarming the DPRK and \"bringing down its social system\" with the watchwords of \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" since he seized power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent days alone he introduced a lot of nuclear war hardware for carrying out the U.S. new defense strategy and kicked up a new racket for a nuclear war such as Ulji Freedom Guardian only to be denounced for acting as a shock brigade and main servant for a nuclear war and straining the situation in the Korean Peninsula and the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As disclosed by a south Korean opposition party on Sept. 10, it is none other than Lee Myung Bak who is so serious about turning the Jeju naval base into a nuclear carrier base of the U.S. forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, foreign experts at a recent meeting ridiculed the south Korean puppet regime, questioning its delegates \"until when it would be under the U.S. nuclear umbrella\". \"South Korea will not escape second-category treatment as long as it behaves so\", they added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee had better shut up his mouth causing only misfortune and dig out his grave rather than suffering disgrace for ridiculously imploring for such \"cooperation.\""

            "content": "Mejora de relaciones Corea-Japon depende de actitud de segundo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 17 de septiembre (ACNC) -- Han transcurrido 10 anos desde cuando fue aprobada la Declaracion de Pyongyang Corea-Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 17 de septiembre de 2002 los lideres de Corea y Japon firmaron por primera vez en la historia la Declaracion de Pyongyang Corea-Japon, cuyo espiritu fundamental es liquidar el desagradable pasado entre los dos paises, resolver los problemas pendientes y establecer las fructuosas relaciones politicas, economicas y culturales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta declaracion es el jalon para el mejoramiento de las relaciones entre estos dos paises, que aclaro  generalmente la meta, el principio y los medios fundamentales para el particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien refleja la voluntad de los pueblos de los dos paises de crear la nueva historia del mejoramiento de las relaciones al liquidar el deshonroso pasado, prohibir las acciones  amenazantes a la seguridad mutua y cooperar mutuamente por la paz y la estabilidad del Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobierno de la RPDC hizo todos los esfuerzos posibles por la ejecucion exitosa de esta declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, desde el principio, Japon frustro la ejecucion de todos los articulos tergiversando e insultando el espiritu fundamental del documento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl adherirse a la politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU., no ejecuto ni uno de los articulos de la declaracion y los invalido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl embellecer y justificar la historia de agresion a Corea que impuso incontables desgracias y dolores al pueblo coreano incluyendo el crimen de las esclavas sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones, este pais isleno quebranto el articulo de la liquidacion del pasado criminal, fundamento de la ejecucion de la declaracion y la condicion previa del mejoramiento de las relaciones con Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl acusar obstinadamente a la RPDC de \"problema de armas nucleares, misiles y secuestros\" incito en su territorio nacional la hostilidad anti-RPDC e impulso activamente las maquinaciones de expansion militarista, asi como convirtio las relaciones bilaterales en las hostiles mas peores que antes de la aprobacion de la declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se resuelve el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana y se alivia la situacion de esta, Japon perdera el pretexto de la realizacion de la potencia militar incluyendo el armamento nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, el pais isleno puso obstaculos uno por uno en las conversaciones a 6 bandas por la resolucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"problema de misiles\" de que habla Japon, no pasa de ser un pretexto de establecer junto con EE.UU. el sistema antimisiles y lanzar el satelite espia bajo el rotulo de asegurar la paz y la estabilidad del Nordeste Asiatico y ademas, completar los preparativos por la conversion de su pais en la potencia militar y por la reagresion a Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu ejemplo fehaciente es que recientemente, Japon asento una base legal por la militarizacion espacial y el armamento nuclear pretextando la \"amenaza de misiles\" de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas hostiles anti-RPDC de Japon usan en el malsano proposito politico el \"problema de secuestro\" resuelto ya gracias a los esfuerzos sinceros del gobierno de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, ellas inventaron de continuo los nuevos \"datos de secuestro\" y los usaron para ocultar el crimen del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstablecieron por doquier el aparato  gubernamental y otros intrigantes que tratan el \"problema de secuestro\" y los utilizaron como mecanismos para elevar la popularidad de los politiqueros conservadores y como medios para ganar dinero para quienes trabajan en estas esferas, de manera que produjeron la \"industria de secuestro\" nunca vista en todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad de Japon de hoy es que cuando unos parlotean del \"problema de secuestro\" pueden ser \"nacionalistas\" y \"patriotas\" y mantener la vida los fulanos de la \"Sociedad para salvar a secuestros\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de tal problema, las autoridades japonesas perpetraron brutalmente la persecucion politica y la represion a los coreanos residentes en Japon y la Chongryon (Asociacion General de Coreanos Residentes en Japon), entidad legal de ciudadanos en ultramar de la RPDC, y violaron despiadadamente los derechos a la existencia y los nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo muestran los hechos, el alboroto de \"armas nucleares, misiles y secuestro\" de las autoridades japonesas adheridas a la politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU. es el acto violador y destructor de la declaracion arriba mencionada por el desarrollo de las relaciones bilaterales y el aseguramiento de la paz y la seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la brutal politica y maniobras  conflictivas de Japon la Declaracion de Pyongyang Corea-Japon se ha venido tergiversando gravemente como si fuera un documento para  solucionar el \"problema de armas nucleares, misiles y secuestro\" en contrapelo de su noble ideal y espiritu y cada dia mas se ha hecho lejana la solucion de esta declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Japon apela de continuo al \"problema de armas nucleares,  misiles y secuestro\" en adhesion a EE.UU. sin comprender la gravedad de la situacion creada, las relaciones con Corea no se podran mejorar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConvertir las relaciones entre la RPDC y Japon en las que estos dos paises sean los vecinos y cercanos no en los lejanos aunque estan situados cerca, mediante la mejora de las relaciones RPDC-Japon esto es el legado del Generalisimo de Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs invariable la posicion del gobierno de la RPDC de ejecutar hasta el fin la Declaracion de Pyongyang Corea-Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades japonesas tienen de veras la voluntad de contribuir al desarrollo de las relaciones entre los dos paises y los pueblos y la paz y la estabilidad de la region, deben abandonar su anacronica politica hostil anti-RPDC y ejecutar la historica Declaracion de Pyongyang Corea-Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMejorar las relaciones Corea-Japon conforme a la esperanza de la sociedad internacional del nuevo siglo y los pueblos de los dos paises, depende enteramente de la actitud de Japon."
