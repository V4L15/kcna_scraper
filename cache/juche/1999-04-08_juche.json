Debates on the first agenda item \"on the summing up of the fulfillment of the state budget for Juche 87 (1998) and on the state budget for Juche 88 (1999) in the DPRK\" continued there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The speakers said that the state budget for 1998 creditably ensured the sacred struggle to consolidate the political foundation of the revolutionary government as firm as a rock, enhance the might of the single-hearted unity of the leader, party, army and people in every way and firmly defend and glorify the socialist system.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state budget for 1999 is a revolutionary and dynamic one which can financially guarantee the heroic struggle of the Korean people and People's Army to bring about a great change in building a powerful nation by speeding up the second grand Chollima march, they said, and fully supported and approved it.   They underscored the need to increase the political, military and economic might of the country by successfully implementing the state budget for this year.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sitting debated on the second agenda item \"on adopting a law of the DPRK on the plan of the national economy.\"   Yang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the presidium of the SPA, delivered a report at the sitting in which  the draft law of the DPRK on the plan of the national economy was read out.   Discussions on the second agenda item took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter and speakers said that to adopt the law at the historic time when the Korean revolution has entered the stage of new change would mark another significant occasion in fully demonstrating the validity of the policy of the Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government on the planning of the national economy and the vitality of the planned socialist economy and accelerating the cause of building a powerful nation  of Juche in spite of difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The law presented to the SPA for consideration is a Juche-based law which fixes by law the achievements made in the planning work in the past and which  fully represents the party's policy on planning and a Korean-style revolutionary law on the plan which reflects the invariable will of the Worker's Party, state and people of Korea that have maintained the principle of planned management in socialist economic construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They pointed out that the law on the plan of the national economy fully stipulates the principles, system and method of the planned socialist economy in keeping with the requirements of the developing revolution, and voiced full support and approval for the law by proposing to adopt it as it is.

It is a cock-and-bull argument because there is no 'POW' in the north. We are not 'POWs.'\"   This was stated by Kim Jun Gyong, 74, who was born in Yongyang county, North Kyongsang Province, and resides in Seumul-ri, Ryokpho district, Pyongyang.   During the last Korean War (June 1950-July 1953) he was drafted into the \"ROK army\" in South Korea and then defected to the north to serve the Korean People's Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers are now describing as \"POWs\" those like him who voluntarily defected to the DPRK and served in the KPA. This is an intolerable insult and the height of impudence, Kim said, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After defecting to the north in June 1952, I fought in Kimhwa area of the central front as a People's Army soldier. I,  who was denied the opportunity of going to school in the south, learnt our mother tongue  at a military political academy after defection.   My days in the \"ROK\" army were really terrible. So, I and my fellows quit the \"ROK\" army and defected to the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the north, I found so many people like me.   I had many opportunities to meet them. They were equally proud of their happy families and life in the north.   After getting discharged from military service, I graduated from a college of agriculture and became a member of the Worker's Party of Korea and a livestock engineer.   I had served as sub-work-team leader of a state-run stock-farm until I retired from my post.   Being a war veteran, I have no worries about my livelihood, always enjoying benefits from the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through my  experience both in the north and south, I have realized that the north is a society for the people where all the people enjoy a harmonious life. How can we leave such a good place?   I will never go back to the south under whatever circumstances.   The South Korean rulers  should not urge us to  come back to the south  which has been turned to a veritable hell under the rule of the U.S. but  immediately allow the  repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners to the north where they were born. \r\n\r\n"

They are recollecting with deep emotion the tireless efforts exerted by the President Kim Il Sung to build the nation's post and telecommunications.

But it has developed to be an independent and comprehensive one equipped with up-to-date technologies.

A well-organized communications system has been set up throughout the country through the readjustment and reinforcement of the overall telephone cables and the introduction of up-to-date equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Various kinds of carrier telephones were produced and installed and a larger number of direct telephone circuits have been connected to key factories and enterprises from state institutions.   A phone exchange has been computerized and cables have been replaced by optical cables  through the introduction of ultra-modern communications equipment, including automatic digital phone switchboards and  great capacity impulse-code modulators. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is a well-organized international phone system which satisfactorily meets the  growing needs of international communications.    Radio and wire  broadcasting stations and relay TV broadcasting stations across the country have been rebuilt on an expansion basis and readjusted and reinforced. There is also a well-regulated relay broadcasting system.   There began microwave FM service and relay broadcasting was realized in major cities,  with the result that the inner structure of the broadcasting system has been perfected and diversified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Material and technological foundations of factories producing communication apparatuses and their scientific research institutions  have been consolidated.

Chun Doo Hwan frequently sent teams specializing in the development of biological and chemical weapons to the United States to introduce its successes in research and hurried up with joint development with U.S. germ weapons institutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the mid-1980s, South Korea succeeded in experimenting bacteria and virus on living bodies and put the production of poisonous substances for chemical weapons on an industrial footing.   The Roh Tae Woo group put spurs to the work to put the development of biological and chemical weapons on a stage of full application.   Experts on biological and chemical weapons were included in a medical team of the \"ROK\" army dispatched for the gulf war to verify the effectiveness of South Korean-made biological and chemical weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"civilian\"-veiled Kim Young Sam group of war hawks made an official decision to possess chemical weapons at the end of 1993 on the plea of \"coping with the north's development of biological and chemical weapons\" and submitted it to the \"National Assembly\" in 1994 for ratification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung \"government\" has pumped a colossal amount of money and manpower into the project to possess its \"powerful capacity for biological and chemical warfare,\" while floating the rumour about \"the north's development of biological and chemical weapons\" in a bid to convince the international community, following the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Referring to the truth behind the development of biological and chemical weapons in South Korea and its seriousness, the indictment further said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 1,000 persons are engaged in the study and development of germ weapons in South Korea. This started in the form of \"collaboration\" with the United States.   In the mid-1980s, at least 70 kinds of pathogenic bacteria for germ warfare were developed as a result of successes in study.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While experimenting bacteria and virus on living bodies, the South Korean authorities pushed ahead with the production of arms which can carry, drop and launch those weapons.   For example, the germ weapons institute under the \"Ministry of National Defense\" has thousands of special containers for military use which keep pathogenic bacteria and germs. In addition, tens of thousands of weapons of various kinds capable of carrying bacteria and virus are stockpiled at the \"secret arsenals\" under the corps, divisions, regiments and battalions of the \"ROK\" army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons in South Korea has entered a serious stage.   The chemical institute of South Korea had produced as many as 10,000 compound substances as guinea pigs from 1982 to 1987, while the Samyang chemical technical institute completed the development of more than 30 kinds of \"new goods\"  for chemical weapons in 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After having built many factories which produce deadly poisonous gas, the South Korean authorities are speeding up its production.   At present, South Korea has tens of thousands of tons of poisonous substances and several million chemical bombs stockpiled in frontline areas and other parts of South Korea including Kwangju and Taegu.   It has also established  a system needed for using the stockpiled biological and chemical weapons for real actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities' criminal production of biological and chemical weapons and the stockpiling of them  for real war are not only a  frontal challenge to the September 1992 international convention on prohibition of the development, production, stockpile and use of chemical weapons but also a hostile act of going against the north-south agreement on non-aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In conclusion, Hanminjon expressed the hope that the world conscience would heighten vigilance against South Korea's frantic moves to arm itself with biological and chemical weapons which is being stepped up under the support of the U.S. and take the same step as the South Korean people in the struggle to frustrate them. \r\n\r\n"

The small tray, 21.9 cm in diameter, gives a glimpse of Korea's advanced handcraftsmanship.   The Korean handicraft industry is still carrying on its long-standing tradition. Every encouragement is given by the government to the development of this industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Handicrafts studios are found everywhere throughout the country. In this field emphasis is laid on the judicious combination of traditionalism and modernism. Various methods of technical art are in wide use to raise the cultivated taste in handicrafts.   The world-famous  Koryo celadon is inlaid with white or black clay, the woodworks from the ri dynasty have delicate inlays and the stone works from the same period are spangled with gold, silver and other precious metals. These traditional masterstrokes have been taken over by contemporary handicrafts and serve as a guarantee for a remarkable artistic capacity. \r\n\r\n"
