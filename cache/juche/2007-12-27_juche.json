            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives On-Site Guidance to Pig Farms  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 26 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to the newly built  and reconstructed pig farms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak Nam Gi, department director of the Central Committee of the WPK, Ri Yong Chol and Ri Jae Il, first vice-department directors of the C.C., the WPK, and KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the Sariwon Pig Farm newly built by people in North Hwanghae Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the farm before a huge painting showing the panoramic view of the farm, he went round the outside and inside of the farm to acquaint himself with its construction and management. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He walked round pigsties and the feed processing room and other places of the farm to learn about the technical equipment and the pig breeding there. He expressed satisfaction over the fact that the employees of the farm are devoting their wisdom and enthusiasm to the efforts to increase the supply of pork to people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to be implemented by the farm, noting that the appearance of one more modern pig farm in Sariwon made it possible to boost the pork production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the October 7 Pig Farm reconstructed by servicepersons of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round the production processes on the farm, Kim Jong Il acquainted himself with the technological updating and pig breeding there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After going round the pig farms, he set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for further developing the nation's stockbreeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted that to develop stock-breeding is one of the important ways of increasing the supply of meat to the people but also boosting the grain production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that in order to increase the production of pork at the pig farms it is necessary to thoroughly establish a scientific management system based on modern technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The breeding on the chicken farms and pig farms that sprang up in recent years has been put on a scientific basis and this resulted in leaping progress in livestock products, he said, adding that the experience goes to prove that it is possible to bring about a fresh turn in stock-breeding, too, in a brief span of time when the revolutionary spirit and creative ingenuity of people are given full play on the basis of the advantages of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that it is the aim of Korean-style socialism to protect and meet the wishes and interests of the people, he called on all fields and units to wage a dynamic drive to further develop the stock-breeding as a mass movement and thus provide the people with a more affluent and highly civilized life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Recently MSDF Aegis destroyer \"Kongo\" shot down a ballistic missile with a \"SM-3\" in a test, the first of its kind, conducted with the backing of the U.S. naval force.

Nevertheless, the situation of the Korean Peninsula still remains tense. This is entirely attributable to the U.S. anachronistic hostile policy of aggression toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the U.S. policy toward the DPRK, the policy of aggression based on its military power, is the main factor of escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"RSOI\", \"Foal Eagle\" and \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises staged in south Korea by the U.S. bellicose forces were war moves against the DPRK, which showed that there is no change in the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the U.S. has sped up arms buildup on a large scale to invade the DPRK, including the introduction into the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding areas of dangerous preemptive nuclear strike means. It is needless to say that such actions are as good as dangerous provocative moves wrecking the atmosphere for peace on the Korean Peninsula and driving the situation to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. occupation of south Korea is a vivid manifestation of its hostile policy toward the DPRK and the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea are an executor for putting into practice this policy of aggression on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has instigated the south Korean warmongers to the confrontation and military actions against the fellow countrymen in a desperate attempt to sow discord among Koreans and check their desire for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has worked hard to further gear the south Korean army to the military vassal system, talking about the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\" at such confabs as \"annual security meeting\" and \"security policy initiative meeting\". It has also offered the south Korean bellicose forces a huge amount of lethal equipment under the signboard of \"cooperation in security\" to set them on the confrontation with the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' policy of aggression on the DPRK is the root cause of ruining the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and a source of aggravation of the tension and outbreak of war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are now dynamically stepping up the general march for the Songun revolution to build a great prosperous powerful nation in the revolutionary soldier spirit based on the above-said spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are fully displaying this noble sense of revolutionary moral obligation in devoting themselves to the work to translate the desire of the revolutionary forerunners to see a rich and powerful country into brilliant reality on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble spiritual and moral traits of the Korean people making energetic endeavors to win the victory of Korean-style socialism and build a great prosperous powerful nation under the uplifted banner of Songun clearly testify to the truth of history that a great leader makes his people great.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A suicide bombing in an army barrack on September 13 killed 15 government troops. In Turkey shops and other places were targets of bomb attacks and in Lebanon several law-makers, public figures and civilians were killed by terrorist attacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Algeria a car bombing in August was followed by another bomb attack targeted against its president on September 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In several European countries bomb attacks, attempted suicide bombings and others have given rise to socio-political chaos, throwing people into uneasiness and terror. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The death toll of the U.S. soldiers in Iraq since the start of the war reached nearly 4,000 and the number of the wounded tens of thousands. More than 40,000 U.S. soldiers who were dispatched to Iraq are suffering from mental diseases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is just part of the catastrophic consequences caused by the U.S. \"war on terrorism\" for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts clearly prove the injustice and failure of the U.S. \"war on terrorism\", the article says, urging the U.S. to stop the \"war\" for aggression and hegemony rebuffed worldwide and drop its ambition to dominate the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
