This is because the principle of independence and the proposal for achieving reunification by federal formula, the core of the charter for reunification common to all Koreans, do not meet its ulterior purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean regime has even an iota of the will to atone for its crimes before the nation and history, it should, before anything else, bring life to the spirit of By Our Nation Itself and retake sovereignty over the issue of inter-Korean relations and reunification issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should respect the three charters for national reunification confirmed as a programme for reunification common to the nation through the inter-Korean agreement and respond to the nationwide discussion on their implementation."
