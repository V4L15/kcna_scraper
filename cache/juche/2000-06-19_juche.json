Hundreds of thousands of them were killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese government instituted scores of laws on compensation to Japanese whereby it pays at least a hundred million yen to every person. But it intends to unwillingly pay a Korean only one-several tenths of its compensation to Japanese, even that only to some Koreans though over half a century has passed since it used them as bullet shields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is nothing but a move to evade its responsibility for its past crimes, an insult to the victims and a mockery of the Korean people. It is also clear expression of its undisguised policy of racial discrimination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's sleight of hand intended to make the victims stay calm and hush up the issue of compensation through payment of a petty amount of money to them will not work on the DPRK.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should properly judge who is its counterpart and rightly handle the issue of compensation. If Japan continues to play tricks in a bid to evade its responsibility for its past crimes, this may spark something undesirable.

There mushroomed magnificent edifices greatly instrumental in consolidating the foundations of the independent economy and demonstrating its might. Among them were the large transportation line of long-distance belt-conveyer of the Unryul mine, the Musan-Chongjin large and long-distance pipeline for the transport of concentrates, ore-dressing plant no.3 of the Komdok mine, the West Sea Barrage, the northern railways, the Tower of the Juche Idea, the Arch of Triumph, the Grand People's Study House, Changgwang Street, Munsu Street and Kwangbok Street. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK underwent unprecedented ordeals and difficulties in the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state was not in a position to properly provide the people with food and consumer goods because of the imperialists' persistent moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, drop in production in all fields of the national economy owing to several years of natural disasters and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the 1990s the Korean people suffered the nation's biggest loss that was the demise of the President Kim Il Sung whom they acclaimed for the first time in its history spanning thousands of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The whole world worried over the future of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But Kim Jong Il stood against the military pressure and the \"nuclear inspection racket\" of the enemy with his iron-will and courage, thus firmly defending the national dignity and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He accomplished most successfully the cause of perpetuating the memory of Kim Il Sung, striking the world with admiration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He has administered the army-first politics. Under this great leadership the Korean people have achieved the single-hearted unity of the leader, party and the masses which was a decisive factor of enabling the DPRK to rank itself among satellite possessors and lay foundations of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not a few successes have been made in different fields but the economic situation of the country and the people's living are far from satisfactory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the Korean people are forging ahead, confident of a rosy future and victory as Kim Jong Il is standing in the van of the Korean revolution. \r\n\r\n"

It is the consistent stand of the DPRK government to defuse the tensions and reunify the country independently and peacefully through dialogue and negotiation. This has been proven in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though the U.S. absurdly asserts that the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea is premature, their pullback is an unavoidable obligation of the U.S. and an urgent need of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States should pull its aggression troops out of South Korea unconditionally and immediately for the sake of peace and reunification of Korea and peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. This will be beneficial to the U.S. itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
