Therefore, there can be no unilateral concession and compromise under anyone's pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This issue can be settled only through the DPRK-U.S. direct negotiations strictly based on the principle of impartiality, equality and confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How the U.S. will approach the direct talks with the DPRK is a yardstick telling whether it is willing to settle the nuclear issue or not and showing its stand and attitude toward war and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no change in our principled stand to settle the pending issues between the DPRK and U.S. through direct talks and the DPRK is working hard to that end. The direct talks and the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. serve as the master key to settling the sensitive pending issues between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ball is in the U.S. court, not in the DPRK's court.    \r\n\r\n"

In the paper Japan even \"advised the DPRK to take concrete action including refreeze of its nuclear facilities and immediate scrapping of the nuclear program.\"\r\n In this regard Minju Joson Tuesday says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before commenting on the Japanese authorities' stand on the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, we can not but express disgust at the imprudent behavior of Japan which does not know where it stands now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is not an issue which admits of any third party's meddling. In view of its origin and nature, it can be solved only when the U.S., the author of the issue, and the DPRK, the direct party concerned, sit face to face for sincere negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's imprudent act pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK is only intended to peddle in the issue in a bid to improve its image and fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need for Japan to say this or that about the matter as the DPRK and the U.S. are quite capable of handling it. If Japan keeps acting rashly as regards the issue, refusing to face up to the reality, it will have to pay dearly for its misbehaviour. \r\n   \r\n"

But he has spent over 3,600 days since then. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He remained true to his revolutionary principle for 34 years of his prison life. But this fact was not known to the world till Juche 78 (1989) when his memoirs was carried by a publication of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was repatriated to the socialist homeland on March 19, Juche 82 (1993), 4 years later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When he was coming back to the north as a disabled man, he said that he had nothing but faith and respect for President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strong mainstay that helped Ri survive a 34-year-long life behind bars was his absolute faith and reverence for the leaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The multi-part Korean feature film \"the nation and destiny\" (parts 11, 12 and 13) truthfully depicts his spiritual world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After his return to the north, he wrote such words of songs as \"led by you, we will win,\" \"ode to faith and will\" and \"thought of love\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These songs reflecting the firm faith and will that we will surely emerge victorious as long as we advance with the absolute worship of Kim Jong Il under his leadership grip the hearts of the servicemen and people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri In Mo is leading a happy life, adding shine to his honour as a revolutionary under the care of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

Yet, it is talking about someone's possible \"provocation\". This is no more than the American-style brigandish logic reminiscent of a guilty party filing the suit first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. escalated moves for a new war compel the people and people's army of the DPRK to further heighten the revolutionary vigilance. They are fully ready to go into action to wipe out the aggressors at one stroke by powerful self-defensive means.    \r\n\r\n"

The danger of a nuclear war increasing hourly on the Korean Peninsula requires all the Koreans at home and abroad to carry out an urgent national task for shattering the U.S. war moves and protecting the sovereignty of the nation and the peace of the country through national cooperation, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the danger of war comes from the U.S., not from the north and the south, he went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that there exists on the Korean Peninsula the confrontation between the whole Korean nation and the united states, all Koreans should unite and turn out as one to get the U.S. troops and their nuclear weapons and all other lethal weapons withdrawn from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As an immediate action all the fellow countrymen should launch a vigorous struggle to check the DPRK-targeted military exercises being staged by the U.S. and the South Korean belligerent forces after amassing their aggression armed forces in and around the Korean Peninsula under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The fellow countrymen in the north, the south and abroad should let this year provide a decisive occasion of boosting national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration to the letter from the firm independent stand that the Korean nation goes its own way no matter how the situation may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pro-reunification patriotic organizations are still labeled as \"enemy-benefiting\" ones and excluded from the nation's common functions in South Korea though it will be three years since the publication of the joint declaration. This reality is souring the atmosphere of national reconciliation and unity and laying big obstacles in the way of national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Activities of pro-reunification patriotic organizations and figures should no longer be called into question or become a target of suppression for the mere reason that they have differing ideology and religious belief in the era of national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the army-based policy of the DPRK provides the surest guarantee for protecting the dignity and sovereignty of the whole nation, averting a war and defending peace, the reporter stressed that all the Koreans should positively support, defend and uphold the great army-based policy with ardent patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report was followed by speeches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then an appeal to the 70 million Koreans was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called for upholding the joint declaration as the only signpost for hewing out the destiny and positively contribute to its implementation no matter how undisguised outside forces become in their interference and how complicated the situation gets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called upon the South Korean people to keep burning the anti-U.S. candles already held high and more valiantly turn out in the decisive anti-U.S. resistance to retake the trampled-down dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that signing a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. provides a substantial guarantee for preventing a war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring its peace, the appeal called upon all the Koreans to come out in the nationwide struggle to get the treaty concluded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for fully realizing national cooperation in the idea of \"By Our Nation Itself\", the appeal said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  We propose to hold a grand national pro-reunification festival to be participated in by representatives from all walks of life in the north and the south and abroad in time-honored Pyongyang on the occasion of the third anniversary of the publication of the historic joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And we earnestly suggest that functions for national reunification be briskly held to promote harmony and solidarity between workers, peasants, youth and students, women, intellectuals, media persons, religionists and other compatriots of all other social standings in the north and the south on the occasion of the August 15 liberation day, the foundation day of Korea and other anniversaries common to the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
