He said this at a high-level debate on nuclear disarmament which was held as part of the General Assembly on the initiative of member nations of the Non-Alignment Movement on Thursday. \n\t\t\t\t\t It is a matter of paramount importance for world peace and security to prevent nuclear arms race and denuclearize the world through nuclear disarmament at present, he said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the development of new nuclear weapons and improvement of the quality of nukes continue under the signboard of nuclear disarmament. Even the attempts to stage preemptive attacks with nukes on those countries with differing political ideas and social systems are getting evermore undisguised. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation goes to prove that to take substantial measures for nuclear disarmament is more important than anything else. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear disarmament should aim at the total dismantlement of nukes. For the present, a binding document of international law should immediately be enacted to totally ban the use of nukes and to unconditionally give assurances of non-use of nukes to non nuclear states. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should take the lead in the work for nuclear disarmament as it is the first user of nuclear weapon and the biggest holder of those weapons in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The further allowance of the anachronistic theory, which specifies anyone with nukes is eligible to act as it pleases, will surely encourage the non nuclear nations to opt for possessing nuclear deterrent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula was caused by the U.S. as it deployed nukes in south Korea and has posed nuclear war threats to the DPRK pursuant to its hostile policy toward Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The final target of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to totally remove the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK and make the whole area of the peninsula including south Korea free from nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable stand of the DPRK to achieve peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue of the peninsula through dialogue and negotiations without precondition. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will positively join the efforts of the member nations to achieve denuclearization of the world through nuclear disarmament in the future, too."

Korean Regime for Anti-DPRK Campaign\r\n Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Zhongnan Regional Association of the General Association of Koreans in China in a statement on Friday strongly denounced the south Korean puppet regime for spoiling the hard-won atmosphere for inter-Korean dialogue and driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a dangerous catastrophe again.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When progress was made in mending the inter-Korean relations thanks to the sincere efforts by the DPRK, the south Korean regime made profound confusion of the right and wrong, claiming that it is a fruition of the \"theory of principle\". Worse still, it, far from pondering over the just and resolute step taken by the DPRK against the moves of abusing the inter-Korean relations for the sinister political purpose, revealed once again its confrontational nature, vociferating about \"act against human ethics\", \"decisive retaliation\" and \"international sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a revelation of the confrontational hysteria to evade the blame for the present situation and do harm to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The basic principle in the inter-Korean relations is to meet the demand and interests common to the nation in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" and the way of putting it into practice is to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime is trying to advertise \"results of its policy toward the north\" in a bid to calm down the protests of the people from all walks of life against the revival of the notorious \"yusin\" dictatorship and unpopular rule. But no one will be taken in by such poor sophism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Koreans in China will scathingly reject the treacherous inhuman act of the south Korean regime and turn out as one in the just action to thoroughly preserve and implement the north-south joint declarations."
