            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Construction Site of May 27 Fishery Station\r\nPyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, gave field guidance to the construction site of  the May 27 Fishery Station. \n\t\t\t\t\t The May 27 Fishery Station now under construction in an east coastal area on the personal initiative of Kim Jong Un will be the first modern pelagic fishery station to be built amid the drive for making a new history of big fish hauls. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the construction site, he learnt in detail about the progress made in the project and gave precious instructions for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He recalled that President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il instructed that fishing operations should be conducted in the near and far-off seas while going out and coming back and pelagic fishing should be developed. It is necessary to carry out their behests for supplying much more fishes to the service personnel and people, he stressed, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"It is important to build well necessary facilities for the May 27 Fishery Station as it is a base for fishing operations by fleets of pelagic fishing boats and fish storing and processing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"In order to successfully build the fishery station it is necessary to build well a wharf capable of mooring several big boats alongside, breakwater and various kinds of facilities for sufficiently discharging, storing and processing fishes and all other facilities for the work and living of fishermen so that they may be impeccable even in distant future.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to push forward the construction project in a three dimensional manner in order to step up it, he personally solved the problems arising in the project including the supply of materials. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction to meticulously organize from now the work for laying a strong material and technological foundation for the station and establishing the pelagic fishing method of Korean style so that it may start pelagic fishing soon after the construction is over. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea discussed and decided on the issue related to the construction of the May 27 Fishery Station while discussing important strategic matters concerning national defence as the work for decisively boosting the nation's fishing industry is an important one for making the diet of the people more affluent and improving the supply service to the service personnel for the purpose of rounding off the combat preparations of the KPA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underlining the need to reinforce construction forces to finish the construction of the station in the best quality within the date set by the party, he said that he would issue an order of the KPA Supreme Commander to large combined units of the KPA to form strong construction forces and dispatch them to the construction site. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There may be a lot of bottlenecks and difficulties in building a modern pelagic fishery station, but he felt reassured as the project has been assigned to the KPA, a standard-bearer and shock force in implementing the party's idea and defending its policies, he said, calling for successfully and unconditionally winding up the project till the 70th founding anniversary of the party to demonstrate once again the fighting capability of the KPA before the world."

Korean Plot-Breeding Organization against Reunification Should Be Dissolved: CPRK\r\nPyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- On March 10, Jong Jong Uk, vice-chairman of the south Korean \"preparatory committee for unification\", opened to public at a working breakfast the fact that there existed \"a team for unification lacking agreement and unification of social systems\" in the \"preparatory committee for unification\" and confessed that they were preparing in secret \"other form of unification without south-north agreement\" and other organization in the regime was also studying the \"unification of social systems.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t He went the lengths of letting loose a spate of sophism that the regime had a concrete measure to deal with people of various social origins in the north in case of \"unification through absorption of social system.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) issued a statement on Saturday in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the puppet group trumpeted about \"unification of social systems\" and \"unification through absorption\" whenever an opportunity presented itself. But this is the first time that it openly disclosed the inside story about its scenario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disclosure of this fact sparked off uproar in south Korea, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, puppet Chongwadae and the coteries of the \"preparatory committee for unification\" claimed that \"it was not true\" and let him appear before media persons to assert that the \"preparatory team for unification through absorption\" didn't exist in a bid to evade the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by his remarks. But this is like crying over spilt milk. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the \"preparatory committee for unification\" is concerned, it was set up as a mechanism directly under the \"president\" and its chairperson is Park Geun Hye herself. It was created by Park in July last year involving the authorities, political camp and NGOs including the puppet Ministry of Unification, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Intelligence Service, Ministry of Justice and \"National Assembly\" under the pretext of working out a \"blueprint for peace and unification\" and \"constitution for unification\" for the purpose of realizing the \"confidence-building process on the Korean peninsula\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive rulers of south Korea had dreamt of wild ambition for confrontation of social systems and \"unification through absorption\" but there were no such heinous anti-reunification confrontation maniacs as the present puppet forces keen on confrontation of social systems by making the above-said team.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces, having an axe to grind and daggers hidden behind belts to hurt fellow countrymen, are talking  about \"dialogue\", \"confidence\" and \"improved relations\". This is an unpardonable mockery and insult to the DPRK and the south Korean people's mindset, public opinion at home and abroad and all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are no more than cat's paws disgustingly kowtowing to their U.S. master keen to bring the dark clouds of nuclear war to the nation and colonial stooges who cannot exist even a moment without the U.S. backing. Yet, they are crying out for \"unification of social systems\" and \"unification through absorption\" in an effort to bring down the inviolable and dignified social system in the DPRK. This is nothing but a silly charade that makes the boiled head of a cow provoke a side-splitting laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"unification through absorption\" touted by the puppet group is no more than a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK asserts the improved inter-Korean relations and peace and reunification not because it does not know other form and method of reunification or it lacks strength and ability.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye, as the head of the \"preparatory committee for unification\", should give a clear and responsible clarification of those outbursts and make apology for them before the entire nation and dissolve at once the \"committee.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should know that if she fails to do so, the DPRK will not deal with the present south Korean authorities."
