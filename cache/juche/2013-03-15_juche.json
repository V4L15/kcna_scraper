            "content": "S. Korea Accused of Charging Progressives with \"Following North\"\r\n Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued the following information bulletin No. 1023 on Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean organizations and people are becoming increasingly assertive in rejecting the \"resolution\" adopted at the UN against the DPRK and the U.S.-south Korea war exercises aimed at invading it while demanding an immediate halt to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They included the Solidarity for Progress, the Federation of University Students in the 21st Century and other progressive civic and public organizations and people from different social standings including personages of opposition parties and academic and religious worlds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They say sanctions can not help solve the situation and the ongoing joint military exercises are offensive ones aimed at bringing down the government of the north, strongly urging the U.S. and the south Korean regime to withdraw the sanctions, stop the moves for confrontation and war and opt for dialogue and conclusion of a peace treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They warned that if the U.S. continues the war exercises far from opting for conclusion of a peace treaty, they will launch an anti-U.S. campaign with the peace movement organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a just act as it reflects the mindset of south Korean people who, as members of the Korean nation, turned out in a campaign to prevent a war on the Korean Peninsula, no longer remaining an onlooker to the present situation that edges toward the lowest point. It also carries all other Koreans' desire for detente and peace of the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the \"Saenuri Party\" regime and conservative media in south Korea have charged them with \"patronizing the north\" and \"openly disclosing their nature as north followers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime's labeling of the progressive people who protested the \"sanctions\" and war moves as \"north followers\" is another unacceptable traitorous crime and a provocation against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime's desperate moves are intended to divert elsewhere the public attention focused on it, justify its confrontation and war moves and exploit this opportunity for stamping out the forces struggling to reunify the country through the alliance with the north and organizations of the anti-war peace movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Infuriated at this, the progressive organizations and people from all walks of life in south Korea are denouncing the regime's moves, saying that the demand for peace against a war represents the north's stand, while the demand for a war seems to represent the U.S. stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime again comes out with the already worn-out \"theory of following the north\", indicative of its predicament in the face of the condemnation at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This only reveals its true colors as the most \"loyal\" war servant for the U.S. imperialists and a group of traitors sycophantic to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative regime would be well advised to face up to the gravity of the present situation and the public sentiment and stop the reckless war exercises and the racket of labeling progressive organizations and people as \"north followers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the regime keeps on seeking provocations for a north-targeted nuclear war in league with the U.S. imperialists, it will face stronger denunciation at home and abroad and meet the most shameful destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans from different social standings should turn out in a vigorous struggle for rejecting the regime's frantic moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen and war maneuvers."

In particular, it turned south Korea into the biggest nuclear outpost in the Far East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, it has attempted use of nukes against the DPRK several times from the period of the last Korean War (1950-1953) and deployed more than 1,000 nuclear weapons in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In its 2002 \"nuclear posture review\" the U.S. singled out the DPRK as one of the targets of its preemptive nuclear attack and even specified that it would use nukes against the DPRK any time for its own strategic interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also justified its policy of aggression on the DPRK, making much fuss about \"threat\" from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Korean War, the U.S. imperialists have committed ceaseless anti-DPRK military provocations on the Korean Peninsula. The Team Spirit joint military exercises, staged by them with the south Korean forces, were a preliminary war or a test nuclear war aimed at attacking the DPRK from sky, land and sea with huge armed forces mobilized from south Korea, Japan and other regions around the Korean Peninsula and from the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the new century, too, the U.S. warmongers, together with the south Korean puppet forces, have staged Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises, straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula on purpose. The DPRK-targeted exercises are for rapidly introducing allied forces into the peninsula in the event of \"contingency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists describe them as \"annual\" and \"defensive\" in a bid to cover up their aggressive nature and purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent UNSC \"resolutions on sanctions\" against the DPRK contain the U.S. scheme to openly invade the DPRK under the name of the United Nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the current crisis on the Korean Peninsula is a result of the U.S. persistent hostile policy towards the DPRK. Nevertheless, the U.S. puts the military pressure upon the DPRK, branding it as a \"criminal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the DPRK's independent mode of counteraction to counter enemies coming in attack with a rifle with an artillery piece and with nukes with more powerful nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK servicepersons and civilians are now keeping themselves on a high alert with will to repel any aggression moves of the U.S. imperialists and mercilessly wipe out all the aggressors."
