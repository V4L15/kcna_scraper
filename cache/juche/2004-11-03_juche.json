Korean Armed Forces' Military Provocation in West Sea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- The Navy Command of the Korean People's Army issued the following communique Tuesday:\r\n The south Korean armed forces committed a grave military provocation against the north in the West Sea Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At around 10:55 that morning, their combat warships perpetrated such reckless provocation as firing several shells at a patrol boat of the Navy of the KPA on a routine guard duty in the waters of the north side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such military provocation committed by them in broad daylight in the sensitive waters in the West Sea where two skirmishes occurred is an unpardonable provocation and a blatant challenge to the north in the light of the present inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean armed forces deliberately committed this armed provocation which may give rise to another skirmish in the West Sea at a time when the U.S. imperialists' moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms have reached an extreme phase. This crime against the nation can never be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to the high restraint and patience exercised by seamen of the KPA that this incident did not spark off a grave armed conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should punish the prime movers of this armed provocation and take a responsible step to prevent the recurrence of similar incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will closely follow the future movement of the south Korean armed forces.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

And it can instantly produce any amount of chlorine dioxide, which is regarded as wide-range, powerful and safe disinfectant, disinfectant of the fourth generation and foodstuff additive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chlorine dioxide generating method has been applied to over 1,200 units.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n Our-nation-first idea is a solid ideological foundation for accomplishing the cause of independent national reunification. It is the source of patriotism instilled into the hearts of all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This idea is immediately the patriotic spirit of zealously pushing the rare superiority of the nation to the foreground and giving full play to it. It is, indeed, a powerful ideological weapon to bring earlier independent national reunification with ardent passion of patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our-nation-first idea is the banner of cohesion closely uniting all the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas under the banner of patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There should be an idea of cohesion to which all the members of the nation respond and which they follow, if great national unity is to be achieved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic spirit of the Korean nation and national temperament peculiar to it should be made the ideological foundation of great unity, if the north and the south with differing idea and ideology are to get reconciled to each other and all the members of the nation differing in ism and political view are to be united into one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attraction and vitality of our-nation-first idea as the banner of great national unity are convincingly proved by the reality today when all the organizations of the reunification movement and public figures of all circles in the north, the south and overseas are invigorating national cooperation and actively promoting the cause of great national unity and independent national reunification in the spirit of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no Gordian knot that cannot be cut on the way to independent national reunification when they are armed with this idea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Urged to Roll Back Its Hostile Policy towards DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- The United States has revealed its undisguised attempt to \"overthrow the system,\" plan to destroy Korean-style socialism, totally denying the co-existence with the DPRK. This has rendered the dialogue and negotiations for the settlement of the nuclear issue meaningless. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article.\r\n Referring to the fact that the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK have reached an extreme phase, the article notes that the former can never succeed in its hostile policy towards the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the calculation of the U.S. that steady progress made in the peace process on the Korean Peninsula would deprive the U.S. troops of any justification to stay in south Korea. It was against this backdrop that the U.S. designated the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack over the nuclear issue, pushing the situation to an alarming phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration has frantically escalated its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, obsessed with megalomania, paying no heed to the assertion and advice of the public at home and abroad that Washington should make a fundamental switchover in its hostile policy towards the DPRK. Moreover, it has only worked hard to internationally isolate and stifle the DPRK behind the scene of dialogue. A series of the U.S.-led \"multinational naval inspection exercises\" staged against the DPRK go to prove that its blockade operation to lay an \"international siege\" to the DPRK and put pressure upon it has entered into the phase of its full-scale implementation. The U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK blockade operation is designed to impose more economic difficulties upon the DPRK, take the initiative in settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and, moreover, contain the former by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, they have further stepped up the preparations for their preemptive attack on the DPRK by deploying a squadron of \"F-15E\" ultra-modern combat fighters in south Korea and Aegis destroyers in the waters surrounding the Korean Peninsula recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tense political and military situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula goes to clearly prove once again what just steps were taken by the DPRK to increase the self-defensive military capability to avert a war and ensure peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to clearly understand who its rival is and drop its anachronistic hostile policy to stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
