He, together with 18 guerrillas, broke through the encirclement by the Japanese imperialist troops on a heights of Luozigou though tens of thousands-strong National Salvation Army ran away. He, with two companies of the guerrilla army, defended Xiaowangqing guerrilla zone from the offensive of 5,000-strong enemy forces which were backed with aircrafts and guns. He launched expedition to northern Manchuria two times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was when the President started on his way to East Manchuria from the first expedition to North Manchuria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stood sentry every night, gave to his men small amount of maize allotted to him and skipped over meals with snow and commanded the fierce battles with the enemy in a hot pursuit. He at last got a chill nearby Tianqiaoling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One morning, he scarcely came to his senses and saw only 16 exhausted guerrillas remained around him. Then a thought flashed in upon him that if they sank to their knees there, the Korean people would become the lifelong slaves of the Japanese imperialists. He wrote the words of \"Song of the Anti-Japanese War\" and sang the song to inspire his comrades-in-arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Arduous March of the main force of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army from Nanpaizi, Mengjiang County, to Beidadingzi, Changbai County has been known as the rigorous period in the history of Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The guerrilla units had to fight battles over 20 times a day at maximum under the difficult condition in which the biting cold around 40 degrees C below zero coupled with starvation and contagious diseases. He commanded the Arduous March in the van for over 100 days, overcoming difficulties beyond human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His sufferings were not limited only to physical ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was bereaved of his beloved parents in an alien land, parted with younger brothers and lost his dear soldiers on the road of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He saved the revolution from crisis when the struggle against \"Minsaengdan\" swept over the land of East Manchuria, a great difficulty cropped up in the efforts for realizing the anti-Japanese united front with Chinese army and \"Soviet enthusiasm,\" the \"principle of one party for one country\" and Expedition to Rehe were raised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many years after, the President recollected with deep emotion that the responsibility for the revolution did not make him the vanquished and straggler of the revolution but victor, so as to keep him upholding the banner of anti-Japanese struggle.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The case of missing pension records and other scandals are an inevitable result of his misrule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Abe wishes to become a genuine statesman who thinks of building a new country, true to the will of his people, he should step down of his own accord, as strongly demanded by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, he is still clinging to a gimmick, far from drawing a lesson from the rebuff he met from his people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that he is a wicked statesman blinded with the greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a shame and a cause of social trouble for Japan to let such a petty guy insist on remaining in the prime minister's office, asserting \"faith\" and \"will.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation has already turned unfavorable to him. No wonder, voices demanding his resignation are heard not only from Japan but from the United States, its senior ally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not wise to insist only on his assertions, refusing to face up to the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe would be well advised not to seek a lucky chance, keen on procrastination.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
