Putting off his home visit, he set out on the work for founding the Party without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time, the factionalists, who did a great harm to the Korean revolution historically, and the renegades to the revolution styled themselves \"revolutionaries\" and \"patriots\" and deceived the working people, thus creating difficulties in achieving the unity of the ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President, basing himself on the rich experience accumulated for the foundation of the revolutionary Party during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, put forward the principle of instituting a powerful central leading body of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First of all, he dispatched anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters to each province, major cities and counties so as to arrange and expand local party organizations and to rally the revolutionaries who conducted activities separately. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the wise leadership of the President and the energetic activities of the political workers, conditions for founding a new type of the revolutionary party were created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of the preparation, the President convened a preliminary meeting for the foundation of the Party on October 5, 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting, he smashed to pieces the efforts the factionalists made to lead the meeting to rupture, clamoring about the \"Central Committee of Seoul.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An inaugural congress of the Party was held in Pyongyang at last on October 10, 1945 with the presence of the President. The congress proclaimed the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea (the then Central Organizing Committee of the Communist Party of North Korea) to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foundation of the WPK was a brilliant victory of the historical struggle for founding a revolutionary party of the working class into which the President had poured his heart and soul during the revolutionary activities and its precious fruition.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
