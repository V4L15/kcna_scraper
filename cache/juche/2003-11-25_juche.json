More than 20,000 pieces of nuclear weapons are piled up in the U.S. nuclear arsenals. As if they were not enough, the U.S. is putting spurs to the development of such mass destruction weapons as smaller nukes and germ weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. imperialists pursue are aggression and war for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intends to build up international public opinion on the \"threat\" from the DPRK through the six-way talks and, under this pretext, seek and round off the method of stifling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is what it calls \"diplomatic way.\" This means a new war of aggression on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The purpose of the U.S. is to stifle the DPRK at any cost by a nuclear war and other means with international \"diplomatic support.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop trumpeting about \"threat\" from the DPRK and make a political decision to drop its hostile policy to stifle it.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

The core of the joint declaration is to settle the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of our nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd the main spirit of the declaration is \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nation is bringing about a stirring reality in the course of joining efforts in this spirit. Koreans from all walks of life are taking the road of reunification and patriotism. Air and sea routes and land transport are used for exchange and cooperation between them while the blood ties of the nation are being rejoined. The whole world is supporting and hailing our nation's ties of reconciliation, cooperation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the United States that is working hard to stem the trend of the times.

The DPRK regards it as the primary task to respect the state sovereignty and guarantee vital rights, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. It considers it particularly important for guaranteeing human rights to thoroughly reject the politicization of human rights, double standards and selectivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third. It is necessary to pay due attention to guaranteeing the right to development in order to fully solve the world human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to a chain of organized terrorist acts perpetrated by the right-wing gangsters against the organizations of all levels under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) in its different parts at the tacit connivance and instigation of the government, he demanded Japan immediately stop the anti-Chongryon campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is serious human rights abuses to impose a unilateral view on value on other states and even force them to change their political system and way of life. It is imperative to pay attention to putting an end to the unilateral act of branding the countries pursuing independent politics as \"violators of human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to give priority to the right to development, an inseparable factor of human rights, and take practical international measures to eradicate the poverty and write off the debts of the developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, a socialist state with the man-centered Juche idea as its guiding principle, considers it as a state policy to steadily promote the human rights of all the citizens in a responsible manner and its government has consistently maintained the stance of treasuring cooperation with the international community in the field of human rights, he said. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Wherever he went he sparked aggression, war and horrible disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous of such a war fanatic to talk about evil and other country's policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is tragedy that he does not know he himself is a kingpin of evil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such vituperation was let loose by Rumsfeld known to play a major role in shaping the politics of the U.S. administration at a time when Bush is talking about \"written security assurances\" to the DPRK. This goes to prove that the \"security assurances\" are nothing but a farce to deceive the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This also clearly proved that the Bush group remains unchanged in its wolfish design to unleash a new war on the Korean peninsula at any cost, far from opting to co-exist with the DPRK in peace, and its inveterate denial of the DPRK system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If his vituperation represents the stance of the Bush administration, it can not but cast a doubt about the prospect of the six-way talks but only reinforces the conviction that there is no other way but to stand in confrontation with the U.S. to the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And this compels us to approach with vigilance the true intention of the Bush administration clamoring for a \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wrong way of thinking and sinister intention of the U.S. bellicose forces to detain us in the conference room and focus on mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on us behind the curtain clearly prove the justice of our decision to increase our nuclear deterrent force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the DPRK government has provided governmental or non-governmental organizations, political parties, public organizations and individuals of every country with all conditions for rendering humanitarian aid in any capacity irrespective of bilateral relations, their political tendencies and positions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case of Japan, the DPRK government has provided it with all legitimate conditions for rendering humanitarian assistance through such channels as remittance through banks and post offices, shipping service, etc. It is also allowing Japanese Korean women to visit their hometowns as desired by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the DPRK government's magnanimous humanitarian measures governmental or non-governmental organizations and individuals of many countries including those hostile toward the DPRK are participating in humanitarian aid programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is only this right-wing organization in Japan that is disregarding the legitimate channel provided for humanitarian aid and resorting to operations to abduct individual citizens of the DPRK in DPRK-China border areas, dividing their harmonious families and barring them from hearing from each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Families and relatives of those abducted to Japan are now living in uneasiness and horror over the fate of their loved abductees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Is it true \"humanitarianism\"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the recent abduction was committed at the connivance and instigation of the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese media have already reported that at least 20 above-said victims had come to Japan after receiving visas from the Japanese Foreign Ministry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And Chief Cabinet Secretary Fukuda said that it was the government's duty to protect and promote their security and expressed his willingness to examine support for them, a clear proof that the government is behind this incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Red Cross organizations of both countries are getting in touch with each other to alleviate the sufferings of the abductees and their families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Article 2 of the nationality law of the DPRK stipulates that any DPRK citizen is entitled to receive political and legal protection of the DPRK irrespective of abode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese side should investigate and sternly punish the criminals who abducted the DPRK citizens and return them to their families without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Appeal to All People in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The Information Department of the Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea issued an appeal to all the people on November 20, according to the Internet site of the \"Kuguk Jonson.\"\r\n The appeal said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole political camp has been plunged into chaos with the disclosure of irregularities of political parties in illegally plundering business funds for the 16th term \"presidential election\" and people's denunciation of corrupt statesmen is bursting out in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indignation of the people at the south Korean Grand National Party, a rare party of thieves and a party of mafia, is skyhigh. The GNP is threatening prosecution, denying investigation and framing up a \"law on special investigation into scandals of persons close to the president\" with \"counter-fire operations.\" This is a shameful act of political gangsters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic Party is turning its back on the chief executive and joining hands with the GNP which has been its enemy. This base political conspiracy of the party is an unpardonable enemy-benefiting act of encouraging the GNP and the ultra right-wing conservative forces which are seeking the revival of military dictatorship by putting down progressive and democratic forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called upon people of all strata and civic and public organizations to turn out in the struggle to do away with all pro-American right-wing conservative forces including the GNP, a den of evil doing and crimes and create a true democratic and political atmosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also called upon the popular masses to form an anti-U.S. and anti-GNP front and come out in the struggle to liquidate the corrupt politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called upon all the democratic and patriotic forces to powerfully struggle till they achieve genuine independent and democratic politics."

            "content": "White Paper Discloses More GI Massacres in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs Massacre issued a joint white paper (6) on November 21 dealing with part of the reinvestigated materials on the atrocities committed by the U.S. troops stationed in south Korea between 1960 and 1961.\r\n The paper says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIs committed man-killing and violence against south Koreans in a more barbarous and cruel manner in the 1960s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the night of February 12 to dawn of Feb. 13, 1960 seven GIs belonging to Company B of the U.S. engineer unit No. 44 arrested Kong Jin Su and six others residing in Jungang-dong, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPusan City for no reason and took them to their unit. There GIs stripped the Koreans naked and threw them into a dent and mercilessly hit them with rifle butts and clubs. As if it were not enough with this, GIs robbed them of wristwatches and money valuing at 12,000 south Korean hwan, their clothes and all other belongings and booted them out of the unit naked. This was \"Waegwan lynch incident\" that was made public on February 24, 1960 issue of World Daily and which infuriated the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Innumerable are atrocities committed by GIs against Koreans as evidenced by the following cases recorded in April alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGIs shot to death or seriously wounded Korean passers-by for fun. These crimes were committed by a first sergeant belonging to Tank Unit No. 40 of the U.S. 7th Division on April 20, a private belonging to Company C of the U.S. Infantry Battalion No. 19 of the U.S. 4th Guided Missile Command on April 25 and a platoon sergeant belonging to Company B of the U.S. 8th Armored Regiment of the First Armored Division on April 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At around 10 p.m. on May 15 a recruit belonging to Company C of Reconnaissance Battalion No. 1 of the U.S. Armored Regiment No. 9 demanded Ri Jong Hun residing in Pangchuk-ri, Kwangthan-myon, Phaju County show him an ID card and shot him to death on the spot for the mere reason that it was written in Korean. This clearly proves the true colours of GIs as most heinous man-killers, plunderers and destructors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On February 7, 1961 an air force officer of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops and three others took away a camera from Kim Kun Thaek, journalist who was in Kimpho Airport for news coverage, for no proper reason, threatened him with carbine rifles, beat him for more than one and half hours, thus putting him in a critical state. They even tore his clothes off. \r\n On February 13 a GI private madly drove a truck over 24-year-old Pae Su Hyon on a bike, in a road in Sakson-ri, Thaean-myon, Sosan County, South Chungchong Province, thus putting his cranial bone to rupture and killing him on the spot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Pusan GIs hang upside down a worker from a crane for the mere reason that he did not obey them and drowned him in water while in Phyongthaek, Kyonggi Province GIs drove a crane car over six people passing by thus killing them all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A private belonging to the Communication Company No. 581 of the U.S. imperialists madly drove a car, killing O Sun I, 5, who was playing on the roadside in daytime on May 27 and a driver of U.S. troops belonging to the U.S. Engineer Battalion No. 44 drove a car at breakneck speed, hitting and killing Ji Yong Jun, 6, who was playing near the roadside of Samchong-dong, Woegwan-up, Chilgok County on June 5. These facts clearly show the ogrish nature of the GIs who do not regard the south Koreans as human beings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The incident of women's hair cutting in Tonduchon that took place on January 2, 1960 was a typical example that showed how savagely GIs gang-raped south Korean women, young and old, regarding them as objects to satisfy their carnal desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops disclosed their true colors as aggressors by plundering and destroying the properties of the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will force the U.S. imperialist aggression forces to pay for their crimes committed in south Korea without fail and take a thousand-fold revenge upon them, the joint white paper concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
