He called on the north and the south to realize national cooperation without fail as the publication of the June 15 Joint Declaration helped them realize that the Koreans are of the same nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jong Tae Yon, chief in charge of policy of the reunification solidarity, accused the authorities of their wrong decision to defer the revision of sofa under the pretext of \"giving priority to the settlement of the nuclear issue of the north\" and dispatch troops to the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution was read out at the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that without sovereignty there would be neither peace nor people's right to existence, the resolution called on the authorities to reject the U.S. hostile policy towards the north and opt for peace on the Korean Peninsula from a firm stand of national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a stark reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The era of independent national reunification has been ushered in and a movement for national reconciliation and unity and independent reunification is making brisk headway as there are the Songun policy, an embodiment of the principle of national independence and patriotism, the Workers' Party of Korea's policy for national reunification based on the policy and its positive efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How to approach the Songun policy serves as a touchstone judging whether one wishes for the wellbeing of the nation, the peace and independent reunification of the country opposed to foreign aggression or stands by the outsiders keen to do harm to the interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should unite close and wage a vigorous struggle against those forces who challenge the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dignity, sovereignty and security of the country and the nation will be firmly defended and the independent reunification be achieved at an early date so long as there is the Songun policy.    \r\n\r\n"
