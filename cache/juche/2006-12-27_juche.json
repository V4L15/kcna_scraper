And, some time ago, the \"fundamental law of education\" that had been in force for 54 years was revised legally.\r\n The dust kicked up in Japan in elevating the status of the Defense Agency to a ministry and adopting a new \"fundamental law of education\" cannot be interpreted otherwise than one aimed to put greater spurs to the realization of the militarist ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy stance of the Japanese reactionaries is to hasten in break-neck speed the policy of overseas expansion by converting Japanese islands today into a \"war state,\" totally throwing away even the nominal mask of \"pacifist state.\"\r\n In reality, Japan is taking ideological, military and institutional measures one after another to realize its ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In military aspect, it is showing strong zeal to strengthen ties with NATO.  Looming up abundantly clear is the crafty stratagem of Japan to zealously intervene in international disputes in the form of active participation in military cooperation with NATO and attain its political purpose of overseas aggression through that leverage.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should know that the provocation of a war of reinvasion will lead it to self-destruction. The land of Japs will stand no chance of another revival, if it starts a war of reinvasion in Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Distortion of History by Japanese Reactionaries under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 26 (KCNA) -- The land of Japs is a country with a long record of crimes which ignited wars of aggression against Asian countries and committed hideous and shocking murders and human rights abuses previously unknown. Nevertheless, it has refused to honestly admit its past crimes and persistently evaded its historical obligation to make apologies and compensations, thus making itself a target of ridicule and denunciation worldwide. \r\n This is the topic of a news analysis of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that former U.S. President W. Bush advised Japan to make efforts to heal the wounds of history, saying the Japanese politicians' visit to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" meant their denial of history, the analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, turning a deaf ear to the unanimous criticism and opposition at home and abroad, continue visiting the \"Yasukuni Shrine\". This reveals their sinister intention to create an ideological foothold and social climate for aggression overseas by fostering militarist hysterics in Japanese society. In other words, they seek in the visit to implant among the Japanese, those of the younger generation in particular, pride in the history of aggression and mindset of aggression for realizing at whatever cost the wild ambition to dominate Asia which they failed to materialize in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They have gone the extent to cry that the Japanese King should visit the \"Yasukuni Shrine\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Their shameless approach to the issue of \"comfortable women\" drafted for the Imperial Japanese Army is also made an object of denunciation and derision in the U.S. A brisk movement is noticed in the newly formed U.S. Congress for the adoption of a resolution on the issue. Their moral inferiority and effrontery are forced into a glaring light by their justification of the Japanese imperialists' crime in sex slavery and their insult of the Asian women who suffered humiliation beyond human imagination after being taken away as sex slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In extolling to the skies their past crimes and refusing to make apologies and compensations, the reactionaries of the land of Japs seek to realize their wild design of reinvasion in Asia, come what may. If they become more blatant in defying the demand of the international community to admit the past crimes and make apologies, while engaging themselves in the distortion of history, they will find themselves in greater isolation and be put to more woeful shame.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities Urged to Retract Decision to Dispatch Troops to Lebanon\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 26 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities decided to dispatch troops to Lebanon according to the U.S. imperialists' scenario. This is part of the very dangerous preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK as it is intended to accumulate experience for carrying out their scenario of war against it. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. \r\n Noting that the south Korean authorities decided to dispatch troops to Lebanon at a \"Cabinet meeting\" held in the middle of November and are working hard to have the motion calling for this troop dispatch passed through the \"National Assembly\" as soon as possible, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean war-like forces remain unchanged in their intention to antagonize compatriots and hurt them by force of arms despite the dynamic advance of the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities have already dispatched troops to various dispute-torn areas including East Timor under the name of \"helping in restoring peace\" where they have accumulated experience useful to maintaining \"public security\" and \"controlling inhabitants\" in the areas of the north side in case of emergency on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nobody's secret that the Jaitun unit of the south Korean army present in Iraq got familiar with the military operation to be conducted against the north by carrying out the large-scale long-distance night transport operation that has nothing to do with the mission to \"restore peace.\" The principal aim sought by the south Korean authorities in the planned troop dispatch to Lebanon is to \"boost the capability for logistic support,\" \"acquire the capability for combined and joint operations\" under different terrain and climatic conditions and \"accumulate experience in controlling civilians\" in the wartime. \r\n The south Korean authorities are getting frantic with the preparations for a war against compatriots even in foreign lands, not away from their bad habit dating back to the era of confrontation though the atmosphere of north-south reconciliation and reunification is running high on the peninsula. This is a total perfidy to the June 15 joint declaration and a challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also lurking behind their planned troop dispatch to Lebanon is a cunning trick to provoke a war against the DPRK and provide preconditions for getting positive political and military backing from the outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, at the same time, intended to please their American master keen to realize his ambition to dominate the whole world and hurl with ease U.S.-led multinational forces into the Korean front in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula through what they call \"contribution\" to the UN and \"multinational cooperation.\"\r\n Only Koreans' curses and condemnation and a miserable end await the south Korean war mongers preoccupied with the idea of doing harm to compatriots, toeing the hostile policy of foreign forces towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And a productive upsurge has been effected in various fields of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year also witnessed the proud achievements in the building of socialist culture in the era of Songun. Incredible successes have been made in educational and literature and art fields, and distinguished gains registered in the field of sports in succession, fully demonstrating the honor and spirit of Songun Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The credit for the proud victory and achievements made this significant year goes to the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
