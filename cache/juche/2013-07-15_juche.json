He said he was pleased among other things that the farm is capable of reaping a high and secure harvest of mushroom even in a small area by producing mushroom all the year round unlike arch-style mushroom cultivation grounds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the general control room, he was pleased to learn that the farm has automated a monitoring and control system whereby the growth of mushrooms at every cultivation ground is monitored and production is commanded in real time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round a fungus cultivation ground, he said that it is important to produce fungus in mushroom cultivation, adding that production can be increased when fungi are cultivated by an industrial method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is good for the farm to produce mushroom at both arch-style mushroom grounds and the indoor cultivation grounds built by a dry method of construction, instructing the army and society to build mushroom farms in a big way by following the example set by this farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is necessary to thoroughly implement the behest of President Kim Il Sung who called for turning the country into a world famous mushroom producer by building such mushroom farms in different parts of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underlining the need to provide a standard design in order to build modern mushroom farms and scrupulously organize a work for introducing mushroom cultivation technique and experience, he took measures for doing so with his loving care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the employees of the mushroom farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Jang Jong Nam, Jon Chang Bok, Han Kwang Sang, Kim Kyong Ok, Hwang Pyong So and Ma Won Chun."

He is a hysteric cursed and censured by the public at home and abroad for letting loose torrents of incoherent remarks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was this guy who was compelled to make an apology to the angry Japanese for describing the great quake which occurred in Japan a few years back as \"a severe punishment.\" It was again this guy who was condemned by world people for painting 2008 Beijing Olympiad as \"Berlin Olympiad in the era of Hitler.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Ishihara uttered was so nonsensical that even a news service of Japan could not but deplore that he seemed to have misinterpreted the case that happened in December of 2011 in which a Chinese was suspected of setting fire to Yasukuni Shrine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that his utterances could not be interpreted as ill-advised bravery to demonstrate his image.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind his hysteric outbursts are his wrong understanding of history and his extreme national chauvinism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right-wing gangsters in various parts of Japan perpetrated shooting and arson sprees against institutions of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and organized terror against Korean students in Japan in October of 2003. They went the lengths of hatching even a plot to justify the armed crackdown upon Chongryon by designating it as a target of application of \"the law on prevention of subversive activities.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when public inside and outside Japan became critical of it, Ishihara, governor of Tokyo Metropolis at that time, was shameless enough to justify \"the 1910 Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty.\" He blustered that Japan did not invade Korea by force of arms but the Korean Peninsula was not stable because of division and, consequently, this required annexation to get help from Japanese with same race by the general will of the Koreans.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the International League which was created in the 1920s, he talked such rubbish beyond common sense that \"nobody slandered Japan though the International League existed at that time.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, Ishihara, referring to the issue of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army, remarked in support of sophism let loose by Hashimoto, co-head of the Japan Restoration Party, that \"sexual slavery for the army was necessary at that time\" only to become a target of domestic and foreign public criticism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is inveterate outlook of the right-wing reactionaries of Japan including Ishihara on history and their invariable bitterness towards the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile policy and moves of the Japanese reactionaries against the DPRK are based on lies and fabrications and aimed at realizing their wild ambition for reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bear in mind that their policy and scenario can never come true as they are based on national chauvinism and phobia about Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ultra-right forces of Japan, dregs of the times, had better quit the political arena along with Ishihara whose days are numbered.

This is totally attributable to the wrong way of thinking of the Japanese politicians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It happened only recently that Hashimoto, co-head of the Japan Restoration Party and mayor of Osaka, let out sophism that sexual slavery enforced for the Imperial Japanese Army was necessary for bolstering up the combat capabilities of the soldiers under the situation that prevailed at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even a lady official of the Japanese government who should be infuriated more than any others by such remarks of despising women unblushingly justified the issue of sexual slavery, stunning world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the issue is that such view is not the one of just a few right-wing politicians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the UN Anti-Torture Committee urged the Japanese government to retract Hashimoto's remarks over the issue of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army, the latter adopted a reply letter which noted that \"the remarks had no legal binding force\" so that \"the government is not obliged to follow the advice of the UN committee\" at its ministerial meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese chief cabinet secretary at a press conference held as regards the contents of the reply letter said \"it is the view of the government that there will be no such remarks again.\" This implicitly supports and patronizes the reckless remarks of Hashimoto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is the fact that even youngsters are embellishing the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A Japanese female student once recklessly said that the women in Asia should deem it honor to have been sexual slaves of the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. Her remarks help guess the picture of Japan totally corrupt in terms of politics and morality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an outlook on history and ethics of the Japanese who are all rotten, irrespective of age or sex. And this is a serious matter which makes Japan's future gloomy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Japan has neither made an apology nor reflected on its past thrice-cursed crimes against humanity but is very busy with a \"human rights\" campaign against other countries through its hectic diplomacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that such ridiculous behavior of the Japanese reactionaries has sparked off world-wide censure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Japanese ambassador in charge of the issue of human rights and humanitarian affairs said \"Japan is one of the countries which are highly developed in the field of human rights\" at a session of the UN Anti-Torture Committee held in Geneva in May, all its participants burst into laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such incident something rare in the history of UN diplomacy was recorded as a special political cartoon and tragic story in diplomacy which shows how the international community looks at Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should feel ashamed of its doings after recollecting upon its past, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should bear in mind that it will experience a hotter agony of shame if it keeps trumpeting about \"human rights\" in the international arena, not being aware of where it stands."

Los ejercicios militares de diversos tipos que desarrollan sin parar las autoridades surcoreanas junto con Estados Unidos son el crimen que agudiza mas el enfrenamiento politico y militar entre los connacionales y viola la paz de la Peninsula Coreana.

Nuestra nacion es la homogenea que tiene larga historia y cultura de cinco mil anos.
