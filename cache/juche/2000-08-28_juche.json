Through the arduous anti-Japanese armed struggle, they achieved the historic cause of national liberation by giving a telling political and military blow to the Japanese aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the liberation of the country on August 15, 1945, the young Koreans played an important role in building a new society in the enforcement of democratic reforms such as agrarian reform and nationalization of major industries, the emulation drive for increased production, anti-illiteracy campaign and other campaigns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the 1950-1953 Korean War started by the U.S. the young people displayed matchless bravery and mass heroism in the sacred fight against the enemies and thus reliably defended the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the war they performed enormous feats in the efforts to rehabilitate the devastated factories and rural areas and other protracted struggles, which will remain long in the history of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the 1980s alone they built a large number of monumental edifices, among them the world-level west sea barrage, 250 km-long northern railways and the ore-dressing plant no.3 of the Komdok mine with an annual capacity of ten million tons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In particular, they successfully completed in a little more than two years over 260 projects such as the construction of houses for more than 20,000 families in Kwangbok Street, a sports village in Chongchun Street, and the 150,000-seat May Day Stadium. They thus ensured the smooth holding of the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, demonstrating the heroic stamina of the young Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In recent years when they have been hard pressed for everything because of the imperialists' isolation and suffocation moves and repeated natural disasters, they have made great feats in major projects, including the construction of the 40 km-long Pyongyang-Nampho Motorway, Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway and salterns in different parts of the country by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this way the young Koreans are displaying their wisdom and courage to the full. \r\n\r\n"

As a result, the 40 odd km-long roadbed scores of metres wide has taken shape in the main even under the difficult conditions where they have been hard pressed for everything. They are now dynamically pushing ahead with paving and the construction of set-ups. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK Central Committee called on them to successfully finish the construction of the motorway, a grand monumental edifice, before its 55th anniversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The young builders in charge of the projects for switching  Kanggye-Rangrim and west Hamhung-Soho railways over to electric traction are working hard to finish them ahead of schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The young builders undertaking the Kanggye-Rangrim railway project have spread at least 10,000 cubic metres of gravel in the 72 km-long section and replaced tens of thousands of sleepers by new ones in a short span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs a result, the project is progressing at its final stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fresh innovations are also effected by the young builders in the second stage project of the Anbyon Youth Power Station and other power stations to solve the country's problem of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fish, poultry and pig farms now under construction across the country are now being completed one by one thanks to the devoted efforts of young people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their feats are reported everyday from major construction sites including the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway project. \r\n\r\n"
