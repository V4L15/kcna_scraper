It is the mode of life and regular job of the imperialists to engage themselves in aggression and domination of other countries and nations till they go to their graves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The countries and peoples aspiring after independence and progress should correctly understand that illusion about imperialism immediately means death, national ruin and subordination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And they should stay sharp-eyed against the \"aid\" and \"cooperation\" loudly peddled by the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not be fooled by the \"peace\" ballad of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggression and war moves of the U.S. imperialists are the biggest barrier to the human cause of independence and peace in the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should adhere to the revolutionary principle to the bitter end if one is to be freed from illusion about imperialism. To abide by the revolutionary principle in the confrontation with imperialism is like life and soul for the countries aspiring after independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important in observing the revolutionary principle is to maintain a resolute anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fear of imperialism should be dispelled. If one is afraid of the enemy, one is overawed and can neither say what one wants to say nor do what one should do and, bereft of independence, curries favor with the imperialists, reading their faces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should build up one's strength to thwart and smash the aggression and war moves of imperialism. If all the countries desirous of independence fight a relentless struggle against the aggression and military intervention of the imperialists from a staunch anti-imperialist stand, they can well curb and frustrate the moves of the latter.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Koreans have always loved their country very much and waged a strenuous struggle to defend the country and national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans are a homogenous nation to be proud of as they have long developed an ancient history and brilliant culture, carrying forward their 5,000-year long tradition. They are more advantageous in wisdom, skill and talent than others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strong spirit of national independence and brilliant national cultural tradition serve as a valuable spiritual treasure and boon to carving out the destiny of the nation as the Koreans feel highly proud of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of the country is the greatest task the implementation of which brooks not a moment's delay in carving out the destiny of the Korean nation and the cause of national reunification is the cause of national independence as it can be achieved only through its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident truth that the cause of national reunification, the cause of national independence, would have been unthinkable without national character just as the homogenous Korean nation would have been unthinkable without the national character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire of the fellow countrymen to firmly preserve the national character is stronger as the days go by and this serves as an engine promoting national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration provided all the Koreans with an occasion of encouraging them to preserve the homogeneity and identity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls on all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to strive hard to expedite national unity and the reunification of the country on the basis of the national character irrespective of ideology and social system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
