They called for getting \"firm military posture for counteraction\" and \"deterring the north's provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a revelation of the double-dealing attitude of the south Korean chief executive who has often trumpeted about \"creating conditions for unification and resumption of dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Like master, like man.
