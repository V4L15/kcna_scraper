Korean workers' struggle\r\n Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary supporting the just struggle of south Korean workers for democracy and vital rights.\r\n   On October 22, the 20,000 employees of the Kia Motors Co. in south Korea started a general strike in protest against the puppet regime's decision on \"court receivership\" of the Kia group. On the 25th, the south Korean confederation of trade unions held a rally at which it declared that if their demands were not met, they would go on a nationwide general strike.\r\n   The news analyst of the paper says:\r\n   These massive struggles are an eruption of the unanimous asiprations, desire and will of south Korean workers to win the vital rights and democratic freedom and rights with a united effort.\r\n   The crisis of the Kia group is an inevitable product of the treacherous policy of the Kim Young Sam group which have made havoc with the economy and impoverished the people's life by enforcing the comprador-capital-first policy, not concerned about the workers' living.\r\n   It is only too natural that the strikers, branding the crisis of the Kia Motors Co. As a product of the criminal political-economic confusion between the puppet regime and the comprador capitalists, are strongly calling for the immediate withdrawal of the decision on \"court receivership\".\r\n   Their struggle for vital rights and freedom is an exercise of their inviolable rights.    \r\n\r\n"
