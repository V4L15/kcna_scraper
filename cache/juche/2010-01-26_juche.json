            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Sep. Iron Enterprise and Tokhyon Mine\r\n Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to the September General Iron Enterprise and the Tokhyon Mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the September General Iron Enterprise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conducted by leading officials of the enterprise, he looked round a room dedicated to the education in the revolutionary history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling back with deep emotion upon the path of victory and prosperity covered by the enterprise, he said that another comprehensive metallurgical base was built in the northwestern end of the country under the wise leadership and meticulous care of President Kim Il Sung. The immortal revolutionary exploits performed by the President will shine forever along with the history of the enterprise, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He then went round various production processes including the First Steel Shop and the Rolling Shop to acquaint himself in detail with the technological equipment and production there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching rolled steel of various standards being churned out in an endless stream from rolling mills in the newly built Rolling Shop and stacks of rolled steel in neat pile, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the modern Rolling Shop was successfully completed in a short span of time. And he highly estimated the feats performed by all the builders and helpers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the officials, workers and technicians of the enterprise have done really a lot of work to increase the production of iron and steel materials by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, he repeatedly spoke high praises of noble patriotism displayed by them who devotedly worked to make the country rich and powerful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks to be carried out by the enterprise. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most important task of the enterprise is to give full play to its capacity by relying upon the already built solid foundation for production, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Tokhyon Mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He first looked round a room dedicated to the education in the revolutionary history and a room devoted to the history of the mine. He said that the mine turned into a giant iron ore production base thanks to the wise leadership and meticulous care shown by the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the workers of the mine, remaining true to the idea and leadership of the party and the leader, sent concentrated iron ores to iron works and thus made a great contribution to the development of the country's economy in the past period, he highly estimated the successes made by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the mine before a huge painting showing its panoramic view, he went round various production processes including the concentration plant to acquaint himself in detail with technological updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the miners of Tokhyon turned out as one in hearty response to the call of the party and have registered astonishing successes in the production from the outset of the year full of optimism and confidence in the future, he warmly encouraged them in a high-pitched drive to produce and send more concentrated iron ores to iron works.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, he went round cultural and welfare establishments including a nutrition canteen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing satisfaction over the fact that the mine has effectively conducted supply service for the miners, keeping in mind the instruction of the President that the supply service precisely means the political work, he appreciated the efforts made by the officials of the mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced important tasks to be fulfilled by the mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the workers of the mine would fulfill their revolutionary duty as scouts and pioneers of a final charge for building a thriving nation and thus strikingly demonstrate the heroic stamina and invincible spirit of the working class of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that great miracles unprecedented in the nation's history are being worked every day in different parts of the country thanks to the heroic struggle of the Korean people who entered into the New Year's drive with extraordinary enthusiasm, ardently calling for bringing about a leap forward on all fronts and thus glorify this year marking the 65th founding anniversary of the WPK as a year of great turn to be recorded in the history of the country for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, and department directors and first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."

            "content": "S. Korean Conservatives Accused of Bedeviling Korean Relations\r\n Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, puppet Minister of Defense of south Korea Kim Thae Yong again let loose dangerous remarks calling for \"a preemptive attack\" on the DPRK under the pretext of its nuclear deterrent for self-defense.  The \"Institute for Unification Studies\", the \"Institute for Diplomacy and Security Studies\" and the \"Institute for National Security and Strategy\" jointly worked out a report on the so-called ridiculous and provocative \"study of long-term program for unification\" simulating what they called  \"emergency\" and distributed it. The group of the \"Institute for Unification Studies\" went the lengths of manufacturing smear broadcasting literature calling for \"unification through absorption\" with a huge financial investment as required by the report. Leading newspapers Tuesday observe in signed commentaries in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said actions of the south Korean conservative group are little short of a treacherous declaration for denying dialogue and scuttling the inter-Korean cooperation and, at the same time, an open declaration of a war against the DPRK as they diametrically go against the trend of the June 15 era of reunification and the desire of the fellow countrymen for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun says: The south Korean authorities have persisted in their confrontation racket, throwing a wet blanket over the desire of the fellow countrymen for the inter-Korean reconciliation, cooperation and reunification. However, the DPRK has done all it can to improve the inter-Korean relations from a broad-minded and lenient point of view, concerned about the destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities, however, have intensified the row of confrontation, antagonizing those Koreans advocating concord and the improved relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only the \"Defense Ministry\", the \"Ministry of Unification\", the \"National Intelligence Service\" and the \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" of south Korea but its institutes for \"state policy\" studies are all involved in the all-out racket of confrontation with the DPRK. It is clear even to a mere child that this campaign is seriously affecting the prospect of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said institutes have operated for anti-DPRK operations in south Korea for years but never there have been such undisguised and simultaneous anti-DPRK hostile campaigns as what are taking place at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous, indeed, for the confrontation maniacs of south Korea to foolishly seek to realize their daydream, trumpeting about \"preemptive attack\" and \"emergency.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To dare challenge the DPRK making a dynamic advance toward a thriving nation under the uplifted great banner of Songun is as foolish an act as jumping into fire with faggot on one's back. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson warns the south Korean warmongers to behave themselves, bearing in mind that their call for \"a preemptive attack\" only reminds one of a tiger moth fated to perish in the flames."
