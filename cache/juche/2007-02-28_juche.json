They further intensified it with the escalation of the war for invading the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The escalation of the war needed colossal amount of manpower and material resources, exhausting labor force of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They found the labor resources for the munitions industry in the extensive conscription of Koreans and their harsh slave labor. They enacted all conceivable evil laws including \"The Law on National Mobilization\", \"Ordinance on Labor Conscription\" and \"Revised Ordinance on Labor Conscription\" to drive the Korean people out to the slavish labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They took Koreans away in broad daylight while resorting to deception, fraud and forcible conscription. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lots of Korean draftees were forced on medieval slave labor everywhere in Korea and abroad where the Japanese imperialists set foot of aggression.

This is aimed at permanently occupying south Korea, invading the DPRK and seizing military supremacy over northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN Command\" is a dyed-in-the-wool U.S. command wearing the UN helmet in view of the course of its formation, financial burden and military system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who held the posts of commander of the U.S. forces during the Korean war admitted that the \"UN Command\" in south Korea is nothing but a U.S. tool of aggression knocked into shape by abusing the name of the United Nations when it was provoking the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past UN secretary generals and their spokespersons affirmed several times that the command is that of the U.S. forces having nothing to do with the United Nations. In March last year, too, the then UN secretary general made it clear once again through his spokesperson that the command is not a command of the UN forces but that of the U.S.-orchestrated forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is going to expand and reorganize the \"UN Command,\" the byproduct of armistice mechanism which should have been dissolved long ago. This is an act of ignoring the demand of the Korean people and the world public and the UN resolution for dissolving it and withdrawing the aggression forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to justify the presence of the U.S. forces in south Korea and attain its aim of aggression in Korea, the U.S. has deceived the world public by labeling this aggressive military tool the \"UN Command,\" the \"U.S. Forces Command\" in south Korea and the U.S.-south Korea \"Combined Forces Command\" as it thought necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is utterly intolerable that the U.S. intends to maintain, expand and bolster the \"UN Command\" under the pretext of filling the \"gap\" after the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in its information bulletin No. 929 on Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are brutally suppressing personages of different social standings and other people for supporting the Songun politics by invoking the \"National Security Law\" (NSL) and finding fault even with those who have demanded repeal of the law. This is intolerable as it is nothing but an anachronistic act of going against the mindset of the people and swimming against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is that such acts of getting on the nerves of the dialogue partner are being openly committed by the south Korean authorities as part of their anti-DPRK campaign, pursuant to the outside forces' policy, at a time when the once-frozen inter-Korean ministerial talks are set to be resumed and the process to improve the north-south relations is high on the agenda. This makes one skeptical about whether they are truly willing to have dialogue for harmony and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is illogical for the south Korean authorities to talk about the reconciliation, cooperation and improved inter-Korean relations while suppressing those who support the Songun politics in the DPRK and call for reunification through alliance with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should immediately stop such disgraceful acts as seeking confrontation between fellow countrymen in contravention of the June 15 joint declaration and harmful to the efforts to warm up the north-south relations and the unwarranted suppression of the pro-reunification patriotic figures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Comandancia de ONU\" en el Sur de Corea es aparato de agresion a RPDC\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 27 de febrero (ATCC) -- La  \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas de la ONU\" en el Sur de Corea, entidad ilegal que abusa del nombre de esta organizacion mundial, es un mecanismo militar agresivo de los imperialistas norteamericanos que ponen obstaculos en la reunificacion de Corea y el mantenimiento de la paz en la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual del dia 27 y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ahora es cuando Estados Unidos se ve obligado a disolver la Comandancia de las Fuerzas Conjuntas Surcoreano-Norteamericanas\" debido al traspaso del \"mando operacional para el tiempo de guerra\" al Sur de Corea. Como alternativa de ello, pretende mantener y fortalecer la comandancia referida primero en su intento de perpetuar la ocupacion del Sur de Corea, agredir a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y tomar la heguemonia militar en la region del Nordeste Asiatico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tanto en vista de la historia de su organizacion y el financiamiento como a la luz del sistema militar la comandancia en cuestion es precisamente la de tropas norteamericanas con cascos de la \"ONU\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hasta los ex comandantes yanquis durante la pasada guerra coreana habian reconocido que la polemica entidad no pasa de ser un aparato de agresion fabricado por EE.UU. usando el manto de la ONU cuando desato esta contienda belica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En el pasado, un ex secretario general de la ONU y sus voceros reafirmaron en varias veces que la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\" en el Sur de Corea es los efectivos norteamericanos enajenados de la magna organizacion mundial. En marzo del ano pasado, el entonces secretario general de la ONU volvio a aclarar por conducto de su portavoz que esa \"comandancia\" no la integran los Cascos Azules sino las tropas al mando de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esta comandancia, producto del sistema de armisticio, debia ser disuelta hace mucho tiempo. Al contrario, EE.UU. trata de ampliarla y reorganizarla despreciando la demanda del pueblo coreano y de la sociedad internacional de disolverla y retirar a las tropas agresoras norteamericanas del Sur de Corea y la resolucion de la ONU sobre el particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A fin de justificar la ocupacion militar del Sur de Corea y alcanzar su objetivo de agresion a la RPDC, EE.UU. pinto a este aparato de la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\", la \"comandancia de las fuerzas norteamericanas\" ocupantes del Sur de Corea y la \"comandancia de las fuerzas conjuntas surcoreano-norteamericanas\" enganando la opinion publica de la sociedad internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es intolerable que EE.UU. trate de mantener y fortalecer la comandancia en cuestion bajo el pretexto del supuesto \"vacio\" que se crearia despues del traspaso del \"mando operacional para el tiempo de guerra\".     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
