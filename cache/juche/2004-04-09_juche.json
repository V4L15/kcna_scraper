They are very dangerous moves for paving the way for unlimited military expansion and arms buildup.\r\nRodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A complete readjustment of the \"emergency law\" would enable Japan to establish the same legal and institutional system as what existed in the period of Japanese imperialism and legally undertake overseas military operations, unhindered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves would help significantly increase the sphere and capability of the U.S.-Japan joint military actions to pose a threat to regional peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the Japanese reactionaries will take part with increased zeal in the U.S. war of aggression to realize their wild ambition for reinvasion and consequently the danger of military clash and war mount high in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is made the primary target of Japan's reaggression of Asia. The Japanese reactionaries seek to realize their wild ambition for a comeback to Korea by closely cooperating with the U.S. in its daily intensified moves to stifle the DPRK and zealously participating in them. They are set to invade Korea before any other countries and use it as a springboard from which to embark upon conquering Asia and the rest of the world just as the Japanese imperialists did in the past. Their closer military conspiracy and tie-up with the U.S. are to serve this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's readjustment of the \"emergency law\" is a dangerous move to provide a legal guarantee for its overseas reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive people of Asia and the rest of the world should maintain high vigilance against Japan's readjustment of the \"emergency law\" and check and frustrate it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She remained true in an indomitable spirit to her political faith and constancy despite all sorts of sufferings during her 23 years in prison. Even after her release from prison she stoutly covered the road of patriotism for national reconciliation and reunification. After the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration, she was eager to come to the north, but the south Korean authorities refused to meet her wish under an unreasonable pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jong was subject to political persecution and suppression under such evil laws as \"the security law\" and \"law on the supervision for public peace\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can vouch that other unconverted long-term prisoners in south Korea will not meet the same miserable death as Jong's as long as the political persecution and oppression persist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unconverted long-term prisoners are entitled to receive social care and cordial treatment as they dedicated their lives to national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. and the south Korean ultra-right conservatives are kicking up anti-DPRK rackets over its \"human rights issue\" like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean ultra-right conservatives should stop raising a hue and cry over someone's non-existent \"human rights\" but solve the urgent \"human rights issue\" in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon the U.S. imperialists and their stooges for reducing south Korea to a graveyard of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this occasion the DPRK strongly demands an early repatriation of all the unconverted long-term prisoners in south Korea who are eager to return to the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "11th Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Election as Chairman of NDC of DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture on April 8 to celebrate the 11th anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's election as chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n Present there were senior officials of the Party, the state and the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Chol, minister of the People's Armed Forces, in a report made at the meeting said that the election of Kim Jong Il as chairman of the NDC of the DPRK on April 9, Juche 82 (1993) was a successful realization of the unanimous desire of all members of the Workers' Party of Korea, servicepersons of the People's Army and people of the DPRK to have him at the highest post of the Republic and an event specially recorded in its history as it paved a clear way for carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last decade Kim Jong Il has created a history of new change in consolidating the defences of the country and accomplishing the socialist cause with his great idea and leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He laid down the Songun revolutionary line of Juche with his deep insight into the international circumstances of the Korean revolution that altered since the 90s of the last century and the rapid changing trend of the situation. He thus established a new unique outlook and viewpoint of combining the issue of national defence with the destiny of the country and people and socialism and provided guidelines for building revolutionary armed forces for accomplishing the popular masses' cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il clarified a new principle of the building of a socialist state in the Songun era and on this basis increased in every way the function and role of a powerful state leadership system with the National Defence Commission as its backbone and has wisely led the struggle to thoroughly implement the Songun revolutionary line in all fields of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the dynamic leadership of Kim Jong Il that the national defence industry of the DPRK has developed to be one perfectly capable of manufacturing any necessary military equipment and modernizing the whole army, putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress at a higher level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's military might has grown remarkably stronger in a historically short span of time and politics, economy and culture and all other fabrics of social life had made steady progress as required by Songun revolution. This stirring reality is clear evidence proving the greatness of Kim Jong Il's leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's politico-ideological might precisely means the might of the single-hearted unity and the single-hearted unity of the Party, the army and the people around the headquarters of the revolution is more powerful than a nuclear weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole army and all the people should firmly unite as a community united by the common destiny centering on the headquarters of the revolution and fully demonstrate the might of the driving force of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for channeling sustained big efforts into strengthening the People's Army politically and ideologically and in military technique under the uplifted banner of modeling the whole army on the Juche idea to turn the DPRK's revolutionary armed forces into those of the supreme commander of the KPA and an invincible revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to develop the national defence industry and let the whole Party and state and all the people to sincerely support the industry as required by a modern war and the trend of the development of the latest military science and technology true to the WPK's line of giving importance to this industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will advance along the road indicated by the WPK's policy of national reunification and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in which the will of all the fellow countrymen for national reunification is reflected and frustrate all the moves of the enemies at home and abroad against peace and reunification through national cooperation under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit and thus achieve the historical cause of national reunification without fail, he declared, and went to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are hatching plots to stifle the DPRK by force of arms behind the scene of the six-way talks. If the U.S. persistently increases its military threat to the DPRK, wasting time with its hypocritical talk about \"dialogue\", this will only compel the latter to bolster its nuclear deterrent force both in quality and quantity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists ignite the war of aggression despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the army and people of the DPRK will mobilize all military potentials built up for years and completely destroy the enemy stronghold with merciless strikes and thus achieve a decisive victory in the confrontation with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
