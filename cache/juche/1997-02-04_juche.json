What they seek in this is to divert elsewhere the hatred of the people and to intensify the anti-DPRK confrontation moves and war preparations.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group must clearly know that the adventurous anti-DPRK moves of confrontation and war staged under the signboard of \"threat from the north\" will only precipitate their own ruin. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on removing belligerment relations between DPRK and United States \r\n   Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun in a commentary today says that the belligerent relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States must be removed not only for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula but for the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations.  The daily notes:\r\n   At the \"International Strategy Conference\" in Canada in October last year, the united states and other western countries adopted a \"declaration\" on concluding an \"international convention on banning anti-personnel mines\" by the end of 1997. Then a \"resolution\" in this regard was passed at the 51st session of the U.N. General Assembly.\r\n   The point at issue is that the United States, which advocates a total ban on mines, is taking a double-dealing attitude by allowing the U.S troops to use mines in such hot-spots as the Korean Peninsula. This proves that the United States is not interested in removing its belligerent relations with the DPRK. The two countries are technically at war with the military demarcation line in between. No one knows when fighting will break out on the Korean Peninsula. \r\nThe state of technical war affects the improvement of relations between the DPRK and the United States.\r\n   The only way of removing the belligerent relations between them is to replace the armistice agreement by a peace agreement and immediately sign a tentative agreement.\r\n   The United States must not aggravate the tension and increase the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula by allowing the U.S. troops' use of mines there but make a bold decision to remove the belligerent relations and respond to the DPRK's proposal for signing a tentative agreement, though belatedly. \r\n\r\n"

In this period, the wind blows from the south to the north as the south wind is stronger than other winds. As a result, mosquitoes and other insects in the Demilitarized Zone fly toward the north side, inflicting sufferings upon its inhabitants.\r\n   As for \"tests of biological weapons by the north\", it is nothing but a groundless story. We have no biological weapon nor do we produce them. Accordingly, we have never tested them.\r\n   Rumours about \"inhabitation of malaria mosquitoes\" and \"tests of biological weapons\" spread by them are a dastardly rigmarole to impair our peaceful image and conceal their criminal nature as the ringleaders of biological weapons tests.\r\n   The 8th army of the u.s. Forces present in south korea has a large number of chemical units and bacteriological institutes. There are huge biochemical weapons of the U.S. troops deployed in South Korea.\r\n  The South Korean puppets also have become zealous in the production and test of biochemical weapons under the backing and manipulation of the United States.\r\n   There are the \"biological weapons institute\" and \"chemical bomb institute\" under the Defence Ministry. The corps and divisions of the puppet army have their own biochemical units called \"chemical support units\", which have incessantly staged war exercises, contaminating and devastating the territory of South Korea.\r\n   If malaria cases, which are on a rapid increase among the U.S. troops in the Demilitarized Zone, are connected with tests of biological weapons, it would no doubt be caused by biological weapons used by the U.S. troops and South Korean puppets toward the north in the summer of last year when the south wind was blowing toward the north.\r\n   However, the United States and the South Korean puppets are spreading the rumour about \"inhabitation of malaria mosquitoes\" in a bid to justify the fiction of \"test of biological weapons\" by the north.\r\n   This shows that the Kim Young Sam group, who are in the worst crisis owing to the retrogressive revision of fascist laws and irregularities and corruption in South Korea, and their supporter, the U.S. military, rigged up the false story to find a way out of the crisis on the pretext of \"crisis of security caused by the north.\"\r\n   Some time ago, the South Korean puppets peddled a false rumour about \"introduction of nuclear waste by the north\" in an attempt to mislead public opinion to confrontation with the north. \r\n   The South Korean puppets must clearly know that even if they resort to preposterous anti-DPRK false propaganda about \"malaria mosquitoes\" in cold winter, they cannot escape from the crisis.  \r\n\r\n"
