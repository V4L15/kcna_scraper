Koreans have lived, exposed to the war danger in the biggest hotspot in the world, for seven decades due to the war moves of the warlike forces at home and abroad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world has made a tremendous advance and the times have undergone dramatic changes, but our nation has not yet achieved reunification, suffering the pain of division. It is lamentable to everyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The large war exercises ceaselessly held in south Korea every year are the root cause of escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula and bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that there can be neither trust-based dialogue nor improved inter-Korean relations in the tense mood in which war exercises against the dialogue partner are staged ceaselessly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities really hope for national reunification, they should discontinue all war moves including military exercises in collusion with outside forces against the fellow countrymen and make efforts to create peaceful environment favorable for national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The national problem can never be solved by depending on outside forces and national reunification can be achieved by the strength of national independence only. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As history shows, it is the shameless and traitorous act bereft of national self-respect to ask for \"international cooperation\" against the DPRK, peddling the national problem, the issues of north-south relations here and there, far from trying to solve them by the concerted efforts of the nation. This caused miserable consequences of blocking the improvement of the north-south relations and leaving the destiny of the nation as a plaything of outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not seek \"unification of social systems\" that incites distrust and conflict between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south should no longer waste time and energy over pointless arguments and trifling matters but write a new chapter in the history of inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very important for the national reunification movement this year to activate dialogue, negotiations, exchange and contacts between the north and the south and mend the national bonds and bring about a great change in the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now every Korean should not remain an onlooker to the destiny of the nation in crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Responding to the patriotic call of Kim Jong Un all Koreans must turn out as one in the nationwide movement for national reunification and make this year a year of great change by opening a broad avenue for independent reunification."
