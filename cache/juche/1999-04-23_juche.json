The South Korean authorities are frantically kicking up an anti-DPRK fuss, crying over the fictitious \"development of biological and chemical weapons\"  and \"threat\" from the DPRK, in league with the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These moves are nothing but a criminal scheme of the South Korean authorities to conceal their true colors  as criminals involved in the production of these weapons and intensify their campaign against the DPRK.   The South Korean authorities should stop  developing and stockpiling these types of weapons, taking advantage of the U.S.'s anti-DPRK war preparations. \r\n\r\n"

To support this assertion they argued that \"in the last one year the potential factor of instability including North Korea's missile launch has become a reality to cause fresh uneasiness to the region\" and that   \"Japan would be urged more strongly  than ever before to play a leading role in establishing a new international order.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today  in a signed commentary lambasting  Japan's diatribe observes:   This reveals the Japanese authorities' ulterior intention to step up arms  expansion,  arms buildup and enactment of \"law on emergency\" on the plea of \"countermeasure\"  against \"threat\" of the DPRK's \"missile launch\" and carry into practice their scenario for reinvasion.   All maneuverings of the Japanese reactionaries focus on making an aggression on the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is now dreaming of establishing a new international order  whereby it can hold hegemony and perform a leading role.   It was by no means accidental that they imprudently stressed in the white paper the need for \"Japan to play a leading role\" in \"establishing a new international order.\"   The Japanese authorities, who have reached the height of arrogance,  did not bother to openly reveal their attempt to establish a new militarist Asian order and a new world order with Japan as its leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the Japanese reactionary's calculation that they should control the Korean peninsula to that end. That is why they are so desperately carrying on the anti-DPRK campaign over the DPRK's \"missile launch.\"  they leave no stone unturned to realize their ambition for overseas aggression. \r\nJapan has emerged a very dangerous aggression force in Asia. \r\n\r\n"
