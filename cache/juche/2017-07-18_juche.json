Kennedy International Airport by the U.S. authorities that forcibly took away a diplomatic package from the delegation in an illegal and heinous act of provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK termed this mugging by the U.S. an intolerable act of infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and a malicious provocation, and condemned it in the strongest terms while strongly demanding an explanation and an official apology from the U.S. government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the meeting of the UN Committee on Relations with Host Country, convened at the request of the permanent mission of the DPRK to the UN, the Cyprian representative chairing the committee and other representatives from many countries attending the session including China, Russia, Cuba and Syria acknowledged the mugging of the diplomatic package as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of a UN member state which can never be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of State made an official apology to the DPRK on behalf of the U.S. government acknowledging that its security officials concerned made a mistake and expressed its hope that the DPRK would understand that the mistake was due to the security officials being oversensitive amid the deteriorating security situation in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. eventually returned the diplomatic package and all its contents to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should learn a due lesson from the incident and never again commit such an act of infringing the sovereignty of other countries, in flagrant violation of the universally recognized international norms and regulations."

He added that the transfer of the U.S. base would improve the defense capability and combat preparedness of the U.S. forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The transfer, related with the attempt to perpetuate the U.S. military presence in south Korea, is a revelation of the foolish intention to save its troops only in the confrontation with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The goal of the U.S. Asia policy is to occupy the whole of Korea with south Korea as a stepping stone and realize the ambition for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the U.S. forced the Korean nation to suffer the most miserable disaster of the Korean War in the 1950s. And it has imposed upon the nation all sorts of misfortunes and sufferings for several decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from drawing a due lesson from the Korean War in which the myth of the \"mightiness\" of the U.S. was shattered as it misjudged its rival in the beginning, the U.S. has stationed its troops in Ryongsan of Seoul and different parts of south Korea and staged various drills of war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Frightened by the tremendous might of the Korean People's Army rapidly strengthening these days, the U.S. chose the best way to move its aggressor forces bases in south Korea to the areas south of the River Han. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the American style way of existence to save its own destiny without caring about its face as superpower. This vividly showed what the \"solid south Korea-U.S. alliance\" is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation of the empire declining to the downward can never change by transferring its military bases now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very easy to wipe out the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces and south Korean puppet army under the very nose of us as we are all prepared to make the U.S. mainland into ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very ridiculous for the U.S. to advertise that the U.S. base in Phyongthaek is the biggest overseas U.S. military base in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bigger target will further improve hit-rates and fire-influence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean warmongers can never escape from the sight of the DPRK as they are hell bent on the confrontation racket devoting the worthwhile place and big taxes from the south Korean people to the U.S., which is aiming at annihilating the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aggressors and provocateurs can never be safe under the sky no matter whether they are located in Ryongsan and Phyongthaek or in the U.S. mainland."
