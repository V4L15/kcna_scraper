            "content": "KCNA urges Japan to redeem its past \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Japanese foreign minister Tanaka in a \"diplomatic blue paper\" presented at a cabinet meeting on may 8 made oft-repeated remarks that the DPRK's \"settlement of the issues of kidnapping of Japanese and missile\" are prerequisite to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan.\r\n This can not be construed otherwise than a very short-sighted and preposterous assertion made by the diplomatic head of a country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the \"issue of kidnapping\" is concerned, the DPRK does not feel any need to argue about it as it had already clarified its stand toward the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What we should call to question is why the Japanese politicians are persistently raising the fictitious \"issue of kidnapping\" as a prerequisite to improved DPRK-Japan relations whenever an opportunity presents itself and taking issue even with the self-reliant national defence capacity of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given Japan's historical responsibility to redeem its crime-woven past, its moves are aimed to paint an assailant as a \"victim\" in a bid to enlist support from the international community and evade the settlement of its past at the negotiations to be held between the DPRK and Japan in future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only highlights Japan's moral baseness and shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is true of the Japanese politicians' loudmouthed \"missile\" issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deployed in Japan are huge U.S. forces including a large number of missiles targeted against the DPRK. Japan is stepping up its moves to become a military power in an effort to launch reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese politicians assert that the self-reliant defence power built up by the DPRK for over half a century to defend the sovereignty of the country from outsiders' threat of aggression is a \"problem\" to be settled and the U.S. aggression forces watching for a chance of attack in foreign lands and Japan's moves to become a military power serve as \"deterrent forces.\" This logic is a product of the Japanese politicians' militarist way of thinking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should settle its past before talking about someone's \"kidnapping issue\" and \"missile issue.\"    \r\n\r\n"

This is  an unpardonable provocation perpetrated by a religious organization against the DPRK as part of the present U.S. administration's hostile policy to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean religious believers council in the name of all the Korean religionists  brands the association as a group of satans and vehemently condemns it for acting as a puppet of the U.S. administration keen on the moves for aggression and war going against the trend of the times and the desire of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody will be taken in by lies and deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. religious association should stop acting rashly, swimming with the trend of the times, and immediately discontinue anti-DPRK moves and smear campaign, away from its anachronistic day-dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We express the belief that international religious organizations and the fair-minded religionists who love justice and peace will vigorously turn out to check and frustrate the crime against humanity committed by the U.S. \"International Association of Religious Freedom\".    \r\n\r\n"

Korean minister of foreign affairs and trade under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary assails the anti-north remark made by Han Sung Su, minister of foreign affairs and trade of South Korea, when interviewed by AP on May 7. \r\n Painting South Korea as a \"democratic state which improves the human rights situation,\" he did not bother to assert that \"the north may learn from the south how to improve the human rights situation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is a people-centered socialist state firmly based on the Juche idea, the man-centered philosophical idea. That is why its system guaranteeing human rights enjoys an absolute support from the popular masses and all the people have, therefore, turned out in the struggle to frustrate the imperialists' offensive against best socialism and devotedly defend it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His outbursts are an unbearable mockery and provocation to the north, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is South Korea where human rights are abused. South Korea has the world's poorest human rights record as freedom and rights of the popular masses are institutionally trampled down there owing to such evil laws as the \"Security Law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea can never be called a \"democratic state\" because its regime suppresses even pro-reunification patriotic organizations including the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils supporting the north-south joint declaration unanimously welcomed at home and abroad and those workers calling for the right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous of Han to find fault with the DPRK before minding his own business. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His trumpeting about \"human rights\" was timed to coincide with the present U.S. administration's inclusion of the DPRK on the list of \"terrorism sponsors.\" This goes to prove that the South Korean authorities intend to launch a new smear campaign against the DPRK at the beck and call of the U.S. The north is set to judge the South Korean authorities' will for reconciliation and reunification.    \r\n\r\n"
