            "content": "RS Calls for Intensifying Anti-U.S. Struggle through National Cooperation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 3 (KCNA) -- The more desperate the U.S. imperialists become in their moves for a war and against reunification, the higher Korean nation should hold the banner of independence to strengthen national cooperation in every way and thus foil their moves for aggression and against reunification. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is essential for the independent development of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence serves as absolute truth related to carving out the nation's destiny and without it the nation's existence and development would be unthinkable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation feels more keenly the importance of the national independence than any other nations as it has not yet achieved the uniform development of the north and the south due to its division caused by outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve national reunification and accelerate the development of the nation it is necessary, first of all, for the Koreans desirous of reunification to join hands, realize national cooperation and thus frustrate foreign forces' moves for domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is more urgently required than ever before as the U.S. and pro-U.S. forces of south Korea are getting more frantic in their anti-reunification moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the need of the times and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the north and the south joint efforts and realize inter-Korean cooperation is it possible to smoothly solve all matters including the issue of reconciliation and cooperation and the issue of defending peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to boost the national cooperation at present when it is needed to protect the country and nation from the U.S. policy of aggression towards the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to pursue effective national cooperation it is important to see through the aggressive nature of outsiders, discard any expectation and illusion about them and enshrine the pride and consciousness that the Korean nation is the best and a high sense of national independence that the issue of the Koreans should be settled by their concerted efforts under any circumstances. \r\n Dependence on foreign forces and cooperation with the U.S. are little short of acts of treachery and they only lead to confrontation against reunification and a war of aggression against the north. National cooperation means patriotism and leads to peace and reunification.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Talk about North's Nuclear Red Line Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 3 (KCNA) -- The United States is these days escalating its moves to pressurize the DPRK by force of arms and preempt an attack on it over its nuclear issue. One of them is its fuss over \"north's nuclear limit line\" or red line. The red line means a limit to the DPRK's promotion of \"nuclear program\" unilaterally set by the U.S.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday carries a signed article in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far persistently put pressure upon the DPRK while spreading distorted rumors about its nuclear issue. Recently it has gone the length of talking about the red line and threatening \"a military punishment\". This is aimed to provoke the second Korean war come what may, charging the DPRK with the \"possession of nuclear weapons\" and \"sponsorship of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush forces are extensively setting afloat the wild rumor that terrorists can gain access to the nuclear-related substances of the DPRK and this may gravely jeopardize the security of the U.S. if Pyongyang's \"nuclear program\" is not checked, saying it may have produced several atomic bombs at least after it pulled out of the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but an anti-DPRK smear campaign pursuant to the scenario of the second Korean war and a trick to secure a justification to provoke a war under the pretext of \"proliferation of nuclear-related substance\" by the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces are bluffing that they would undertake the Korean war with the mobilization of its navy and air forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have massively introduced sea and air task forces in the Asia-Pacific region surrounding the Korean Peninsula, notably in Japan and south Korea. After making full preparations for the war the U.S. now seeks to preempt an attack on the DPRK any moment under the pretext of its nuclear limit line and ignite the powder train of the war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. current allegations that the DPRK is not too much interested in the resumption of the six-party talks and it is pursuing the nuclear program while employing a delaying tactics are just part of its propaganda campaign to create the impression that the north's nuclear red line is surfacing in reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already declared a war against the DPRK under the world's eyes by designating it as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of nuclear strikes. Now the U.S. bellicose forces are going to make the red line the starting point of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had better stop crying for the north's nuclear red line and make a switchover in its policy intended to stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Its protein dissolution ability is 1.5 times that of the old one. They have also built a process to turn out tens of tons of bacteria a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They invented a new method of producing soybean malt by simultaneously cultivating soybean malt bacteria, halo-tolerant lactic acid bacteria and halo-tolerant yeast. It makes it possible to shorten the production period of bean paste from 30 days to 10-15 days and improve its quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Scientists in the daily necessities sector selected various kinds of aromatic essence needed for soap. Basing themselves on this, they invented a method of making the rose and lilac-like perfume with less production cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Plasticization scientists developed and introduced PVC heat adhesive into the production of ejected shoes. The heat adhesive lowers the production cost by 50 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, scientists in the textile clothing field have succeeded in manufacturing wooden shuttle and rubber picker with polyolefin resins and extending the durability of clothing equipment accessories by treatment of gas porosity nitration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea in a statement Friday bitterly condemned this fascist reactionary offensive against those organizations.\r\n Referring to the fact that the Government Employees Union staged a general strike to win the three rights of labor including the right to strike in all parts of south Korea for three days in November, the statement noted that other labor movement organizations including the Federation of (south) Korean Trade Unions are now actively joining the (south) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Government Employees Union in their actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement denounced the south Korean authorities for conducting a campaign of arrest after issuing warrants of arrest against members of the central leadership including the chairman of the union and heads of its branch offices and dismissing en masse public servants for their participation in the strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It branded this crackdown as a crude violation of democracy as it infringes upon the internationally recognized democratic rights and the right to existence including the three rights of labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a more serious crime than what was committed by any preceding dictators for the present authorities to suppress the labor movement, talking about the \"changed times\" after their seizure of power although they asserted the democratization of society and the three rights of labor in the past, the statement said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a historical lesson proved by the miserable end of the past fascist dictatorial regimes in south Korea that those who are forsaken by the toiling masses are fated to go to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should face up to the desire of the people and the trend of the times, immediately halt the suppression of labor movement organizations and meet their just demand without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
