A spokesman for the North Headquarters for the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth Behind GIs' Massacres issued a statement on May 16 in this connection.\r\n These irrefutably prove that it was none other than the U.S. forces present in South Korea who had perpetrated the massacre of a million civilians the probe into which has been strongly demanded in South Korea, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already disclosed, the U.S. imperialist aggression troops' bloody massacre of innocent civilians started from the humiliating day Yankees stepped on the land of South Korea under the mask of \"liberator.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This massacre is reported in South Korea without a let-up even today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to clearly prove that the united states is an \"empire of evil\" and the U.S. imperialists are ferocious stranglers and the sworn enemy of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the inviolable territory of Korea, leading the situation there to an extreme pitch of tension under the pretext of its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that in case they ignite a war of aggression on the Korean Peninsula the Korean nation will suffer tremendous losses in human lives and properties beyond compare with thousands of civilian casualties claimed by the U.S. war of aggression in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the South Koreans should positively turn out in an anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle to resolutely foil its policy to invade Korea and exterminate the Korean nation, clearly seeing through the aggressive and homicidal nature of the U.S. who has imposed untold disasters and sacrifices upon the Korean nation for nearly 60 years of its occupation of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our belief that the international community that values justice and conscience will voice full support and solidarity with all the Korean people in their struggle to probe the truth about the shuddering massacres of civilians the U.S. imperialists perpetrated in Korea and punish the chief culprit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese reactionaries' wrong use of name of DPRK denounced\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Japanese media are more persistently resorting to diatribes against the dignified Democratic People's Republic of Korea, defaming and wrongly using its name as \"North Korea\" and \"Hokusen\" in Japanese. In this regard Rodong Sinmun today carries an article contributed by dr. Mun Yong Ho.\r\n He in his article cites concrete facts that the Japanese reactionaries have disregarded and wrongly used the name of the DPRK, its symbol as an independent state, and gone to the lengths of restoring the defamatory title of Korea which Japanese used when it was under their colonial domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is an unpardonable act of despising the Korean nation and infringing upon the national sovereignty as it tramples down upon the dignity of Korea and its nation and ignores the existence and authority of the DPRK, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When looking back on history Japan has never properly called our country the DPRK. especially in modern times Japan called our country \"Han,\" groundlessly meaning that Korea was subject to Japan from the ancient times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the feudal state of Ri dynasty externally proclaimed that the name of its state was \"the Great State of Korea\" and \"the State of Korea,\" Japan deliberately called it \"Daisen\" or \"Sen\" in Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During their colonial rule over Korea the Japanese imperialists defamatorily called Korea \"Hokusen\", \"Saisen\", \"Nansen\", regarding it as its colony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even today Japanese high-ranking conservative figures of ministerial level are free to make vituperation against the DPRK at official functions, calling it \"Hokusen\" and \"Senjin\" in Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese reactionaries are so shameless as to assert that it is no problem for them to call the DPRK according to their usual practice as Japan has no diplomatic relations with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the issue of diplomatic relations and practice are concerned our people are entitled to say something to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no diplomatic relations with Japan. The Korean people have a deep-rooted practice as regards the name of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From long ago, the Korean people have called Japan \"Wae\" in Korean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the historical records of Korea prove that the official title of Japan was \"Wae\" and the name of Japan was not used generally. Even today there is little change in Koreans' understanding and practice of calling Japan \"Wae\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The word \"Japanese sword\" that entered the recently printed Korean dictionary is the only word relevant to the word of Japan. But it contains more than 80 ordinary words relevant to \"Wae\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the name of other countries may be wrongly used according to usual practice as the Japanese reactionaries claim, the word \"Japan\" which the DPRK has used in its official language can immediately change into the word \"Wae\" without any argument. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' wrong use of the name of the DPRK should never be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan is willing to redress its crimes committed against the Korean people, it should properly do so from a correct stand and immediately stop wrongly using the name of the DPRK.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It had already participated in the Afghan and Iraqi wars and other wars under the pretext of supporting the \"war on terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent carriage of the bills once again laid bare Japan's true intention to significantly expand the sphere of the SDFs' use of armed forces and launch overseas aggression, a complete switchover from its former policy of exclusive defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly shows what a dangerous phase Japan's moves to revive militarism have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities cited non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to seek the carriage of those aggressive and dangerous bills to cope with emergency. This, however, will entail serious backfire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet shaken off the ill fame of an enemy state although more than half a century has passed since the end of the war. Therefore, its efforts to justify its war moves will further strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula, which has become complicated due to its nuclear issue, and escalate the military tensions among its neighboring countries and other countries in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's ever more undisguised moves for militarization clearly testify to the fact that it was quite just for the DPRK to have increased its self-defensive capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, obsessed with a vaulting ambition to convert the country into a military power, has chosen the DPRK as its principal target. This situation compels the DPRK to take every possible strong measure to cope with it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
