That's why such theory will never work on us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days never to return when the U.S used to pose threats to the DPRK unilaterally with nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Very just is the DPRK's stand that no matter what others may say, as long as the U.S. persists in its hostile policy, the former will continue to take steps to beef up its nuclear force to protect the country's sovereignty and the nation's dignity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better properly acknowledge the entity of Juche Korea, nuclear power worthy of the name, which has had access to A-bomb, H-bomb and even ICBM, and repeal its anachronistic ambition to stifle the DPRK."
