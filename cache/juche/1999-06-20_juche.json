            "content": "Traditional DPRK-China friendship is unbreakable\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- Indestructible is DPRK-China friendship which has a long historical root and which has been strengthened and developed in the struggle to achieve the common purpose and ideal, stresses Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea, today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing out that the traditional DPRK-China friendship, which has advanced in the trials of history, is coming into fuller bloom as days go by, the editorial says:   The China visit of a delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by Kim Yong Nam, President of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, was a great event which demonstrated at home and abroad the might of the traditional DPRK-China friendship that struck its root in the common struggle and was forged in blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the central committee of the Communist Party of China and President of the People's Republic of China, received the DPRK delegation, meetings and talks between senior officials of the two countries were held in a comradely, cordial and friendly atmosphere.   At the meetings and talks both sides exchanged views on the issue of further developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and on a series of matters of common concern and reached a consensus of views.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The China visit of the DPRK delegation made a great contribution to further developing of the traditional relations of friendship and cooperation between the two parties, two countries and two peoples of the DPRK and China and had a great influence on the development of the situation northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula and the world as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the President Kim Il Sung taught, DPRK-China friendship is an unbreakable one which was forged in blood in the struggle to realise the common purpose and ideal and which has been consolidated in all sorts of trials.   DPRK-China friendship has a long historical tradition and root.  Kim Il Sung forged relations of comradely obligation and deep intimacy with comrades Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai long ago and laid the foundation of the DPRK-China friendship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He rendered material and mental assistance to the Chinese people when they were waging the anti-Japanese revolution and the struggle to liberate the whole of the country.  During the past Korean War, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai dispatched the Chinese people's volunteers to Korea who fought in the same trench with the Korean people against the U.S.    The particular intimacy and warm revolutionary obligation forged between the preceding leaders of the two countries long ago is a sure guarantee for the indestructibility of DPRK-China friendship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by esteemed Jiang Zemin, the Chinese people are working hard to implement the tasks set out in the 15th congress of the CPC = remarkable achievements have been made in the struggle to achieve the stability and unity of the whole country and realize the modernization of socialism with Chinese characteristics = and they are making successes in economic, cultural, scientific and military domains on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the PRC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reversion of Hong Kong was an event in which China cleansed its disgrace forced by outsiders and retook the lost territory.   The Korean people are stepping up the grand march for building a powerful nation. They have the unshakable faith that, led by the great Kim Jong Il, they can win the final victory in the building of a powerful socialist nation. As they have such faith, they are cheerfully advancing with the might of single-hearted unity under the difficulties, frustrating isolation and suffocation moves of the enemy and surmounting the natural disasters through the might of the single-hearted unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a common desire of the two peoples to strengthen and develop the traditional DPRK-China friendship generation after generation.\r\n   Bright is the prospect of DPRK-China friendship and its solidity is firmly ensured. The Worker's Party and people of Korea will as ever strengthen and develop DPRK-China friendship true to the behest of President Kim Il Sung. \r\n\r\n"

An inaugural speech  was followed by congratulatory speeches at the seminar.   At the seminar congratulatory messages from the Korean Social Scientists Society, the National Salvation Front of Russia and the Latin American Institute of the Juche Idea were conveyed at the seminar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEdmond Jouve, president of the Council of the European Society for the Study of the Juche Idea, delivered a report at the seminar under the title \"the  Human cause of independence, the socialist cause, is invincible.\"   He noted that over the 35 years Kim Jong Il has comprehensively systematized the Juche idea and steadily developed it in depth with superb intelligence  through his energetic ideo-theoretical activities to meet the requirements of the times and revolutionary practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In just a few years after the collapse of socialism in several countries he published   a series of works including \"socialism is a science\" and \"abuses of socialism are intolerable,\"  in which he gave scientific answers to all questions to be solved to defend  and develop socialism, thus providing  a  great socialist programme to restart and advance the socialist movement on  a new basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il  has applied the Juche idea and the socialist theory based on it, thus performing great exploits that will shine for ever in the history of the socialist movement.   The Juche-based socialist theory indicates the strategic goal of the socialist movement as well as basic ways of achieving it. In order to advance the socialist movement on a new basis  it is necessary to firmly build up the driving force of the revolution and steadfastly maintain the independent and creative stands.   Noting that socialism in Korea is a socialist bulwark in our times, the reporter called for widespread joint actions to defend the Korean socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The report was followed by speeches.\r\n   Prior  to the seminar, the 7th  meeting of the council  of the European Society for the Study of the Juche Idea was held. \r\n    The seminar continues.  \r\n\r\n"

Korea to new war\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today denounces the U.S. for egging the South Korean warmongers on to unleash a new war.   The U.S. conservative hard-liners are now driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, vociferating about \"strong counteraction,\" strengthened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nS. Korea-U.S. \"joint posture\" and \"sustained security cooperation\" over the \"missile threat\" from the north. They echoed the South Korean  rulers' false propaganda that the incident in the west sea of Korea occurred due to the north's invasion, the commentary says, and goes on:   This once again discloses the U.S.'s sinister attempt to stifle the DPRK by instigating the South Korean war likers and is part of their intentional and planned moves to provoke a new war in Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In pursuance of the aggressive \"operation plan 5027-98,\" the U.S. introduced ultra-modern equipment and forces into South Korea and  put the U.S.  forces in Japan and the Asia-pacific region on the high alert and egged the South Korean warmongers on to clash with the north.   This is intended to spark a war in Korea and resort to a collective use of force against the DPRK  just as they did in Yugoslavia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. scenario for a war against the north is shifting to the phase of implementation from its preparatory phase.   Under the situation where the U.S. is to unleash a new war at any cost, the conflict between the DPRK and the U.S. is becoming unavoidable.   Recalling that we are fully prepared for a showdown with the U.S., the commentary warns: The U.S. warmongers should not  interpret our warning as an empty talk. \r\n\r\n"

From the very day when South Korean battleships obstructed the routine fishing operation of our fishing boats, we, valuing national reconciliation and unity, repeatedly urged the South Korean rulers to stop at once military provocations which might produce grave consequences and gave them as many warnings as we could.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the U.S. and the South Korean rulers, in a bid to mislead public opinion at home and abroad,  are spreading rumours that the north fired first at South Korean battleships.   Their sophism is nothing but a desperate outcry of those who lost their spirit from an annihilating blow after provoking the north like a puppy knowing no fear of the tiger.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities had better bear in mind that if they twist the sleeping tiger, they will not go scot-free.   If the U.S. the South Korean rulers persist in military provocations despite our warnings, all the U.S. forces present in South Korea and the South Korean army, not  several battleships or scores of provokers, will be completely annihilated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A signed commentary of Minju Joson warns that if the United States and the South Korean rulers persist in confrontation and escalation of tension, reversing black and white, the DPRK will take a decisive countermeasure against it.\r\n\r\n"

And they officially brought indictments against 15 members of the Hanyang organisation for anti-U.S. national salvation on charges of violating the \"National Security Law\", crying that they wire-pulled the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on this racket, a news analyst of Minju Joson today says:   This indicates that a new repressive offensive against Hanchongryon has begun.The South Korean authorities charged the members of the Hanyang Organisation with propagating the advantages of the north's proposal for reunifying the country by means of confederacy.   However, their activities deserve praises because they were patriotic ones to accelerate the reunification of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean rulers, taking an issue with their patriotic deed, are cracking down upon progressive youths aspiring after alliance and reconciliation with the north.    This shows that the South Korean rulers are anti-north confrontation fanatics of the worst type and that they seek only confrontation and division, not national reconciliation and unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While suppressing students and people by linking them with the north, they are committing  adventurous military  provocations against the fellow countrymen in the north hand in glove with outsiders, worsening the inter-Korean relations and driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.   This goes to show that they are seized with fear.   Owing to the anti-people misrule of the present authorities, the economy has been driven into a crisis and the people's discontent  is growing  stronger in South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At this very juncture, \"four scandals\" were revealed in South Korea, placing the \"second cabinet\" formed at the end of may on the verge of collapse.\r\n   Thus, the South Korean authorities are trying to find a way out of their crisis in confrontation with the north.\r\n   However, their anti-north confrontation racket will only precipitate the ruin of the present ruler. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is clear indication that the incident was premeditated by the U.S. What merits particular attention is that such ill-boding military moves of the U.S. are  timed to coincide with the Yugoslav crisis coming to an end. A touch-and-go situation has been created in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the armistice agreement, only five islets belong to South Korea and our sovereignty is strictly exercised in waters off these islets. However, the U.S. and South Korean ruling quarters are vociferating about \"northern limit line\" established at their will in violation of the armistice agreement. This is a  blatant infringement upon the north's sovereignty related to territorial waters.   The armed conflict did not  develop into an all-out war entirely thanks to our full exercise of patience and self-restraint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe letter hoped that the UNSC, clearly  aware of the truth of the incident, will take a measure to immediately stop the military provocations of the U.S. and South Korea against the DPRK. \r\n \r\n"
