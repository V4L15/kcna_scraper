            "content": "KPA Western Front Command Notifies S. Korea of Possible Physical Strike at Location of Scattering Leaflets\r\n Pyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- The Western Front Command of the Korean People's Army released the following notice Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors, keen on escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen, is planning to scatter leaflets slandering the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, being unaware of its fate on the verge of ruin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to YIN and other media of south Korea, leaflets slandering the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and insulting the noble social system in it will be scattered from Rimjin Pavilion in Phaju City, Kyonggi Province at 11:30 a.m. on October 22.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean group of traitors said that it would use the Association for Promotion of Democracy of North Korea, a collection of riff-raffs, in the operation with the aim to intensify psychological warfare against the DPRK. It is set to send more than 10 huge balloons carrying the leaflets to areas of the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the plan was directly invented by the group of traitors and is being engineered by the south Korean military.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable challenge to the army and people of the DPRK and a deliberate act aimed to push the north-south ties to the lowest ebb.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime considers that aggravated north-south ties before the \"presidential election\" will be favorable for the conservative forces. Human scum under the patronage of the group has common mentality with the group. This resulted in the undisguised operation of scattering the leaflets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm will of the army not to overlook any act of provoking the dignity of the supreme leadership of the country and its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Western Front Command of the KPA issues following notice upon authorization:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. Rimjin Pavilion in Phaju City, location from where the puppet forces made public they would send leaflets and its surrounding area will become targets of direct firing of the KPA from now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The location is the origin of provocation which can never be left as it is and a target of physical strike to be immediately blown away.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. The moment a minor movement for the scattering is captured in Rimjin Pavilion and in its vicinity, merciless military strike by the Western Front will be put into practice without warning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scattering of leaflets amounts to an undisguised psychological warfare, breach of the Korean Armistice Agreement and an unpardonable war provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. South Korean inhabitants at Rimjin Pavilion and its surrounding area are requested to evacuate in anticipation of possible damage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe KPA never makes an empty talk."
