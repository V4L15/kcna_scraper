It is not the success of the U.S. for it to have listed this country as an \"axis of evil\", because it is not flexible. The international community is now interested in normalizing relations with the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

The army in the north is a symbol of peace whereas the army in the U.S. is a symbol of aggression and plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 21st century will surely be prosperous thanks to independence and beautiful thanks to peace because there are Pyongyang where Kim Jong Il turns the axis of the earth by dint of the army-based policy, the north praised by the world people as the centre of good and the homeland of justice for defending the destiny not only of one nation but the world.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a clear indication that it is not interested in dialogue and the improved bilateral relations but keen on confrontation only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., after listing the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil,\" seeks to tarnish its image as a peace-loving country by falsifying the truth in a bid to isolate and stifle it. But this is nothing but a pipedream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how hard the U.S. tries to use sanctions as a trump card, it will only invite derision and criticism of the Koreans and other people of the world and stoke up anti-U.S. sentiment.      \r\n\r\n"
