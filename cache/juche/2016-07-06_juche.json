Korea's Sophism about \"Denuclearization of North\"\r\nPyongyang, July 6 (KCNA) -- The DPRK at the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea clarified its policy stand that it will remove the root cause of the threat of nuclear war created by the U.S. and safeguard peace in the region and the rest of the world by means of our powerful nuclear deterrent, it will not use nuclear weapons first, unless the hostile forces violate our sovereignty with their own nuclear weapons, and it will faithfully observe its commitments to nuclear non-proliferation, which it has made before the international community, and strive for global denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has entered the new phase of its drive for implementing the stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S., the south Korean authorities and other forces hostile toward the DPRK are spinning out sophism that the nuclear weapons of the DPRK are a \"threat\" to peace of the Korean peninsula and other parts of the world and that no problem can be settled unless the \"denuclearization of the north is achieved first\", misleading the public opinion at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has declined the DPRK's constructive proposal for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty under such absurd preconditions as \"north's dismantlement of nukes first\" and squarely challenged the DPRK's sincere proposals and efforts for dialogue for the improvement of the north-south ties and Korea's reunification with such words as \"north's denuclearization first\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group, in particular, is resorting to all sorts of despicable deeds to solicit cooperation for sanctions and pressure on the DPRK whenever an opportunity presents itself while busily going here and there with the \"north's denuclearization first\" as a cure-all pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a statement on Wednesday a spokesman for the DPRK government denounced this as a foolish act of totally twisting the essence of the denuclearization issue on the Korean peninsula, and a ridiculous act of nuclear war criminals to cover up their true colors and force the DPRK to scrap its nuclear program.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization being called for by the DPRK is the denuclearization of the whole Korean peninsula and this includes the dismantlement of nukes in south Korea and its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet forces have neither elementary qualifications nor face to talk about the \"north's denuclearization\" as they spawned and have complicated the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the statement said, disclosing how the U.S. and the puppet forces derailed the process for the denuclearization on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and the south Korean authorities have an iota of interest in the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, they should accept the principled demand of the DPRK before anything else, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, all the nuclear weapons should be opened to public, first of all, which the U.S. has neither acknowledged nor denied after bringing them to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, all the nukes and their bases should be dismantled and verified in the eyes of the world public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the U.S. should ensure that it would never bring again the nuclear strike means to south Korea, which the U.S. has frequently deployed on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fourthly, it should commit itself to neither intimidating the DPRK with nukes or through an act of nuclear war nor using nukes against the DPRK in any case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fifthly, the withdrawal of the U.S. troops holding the right to use nukes from south Korea should be declared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and the south Korean authorities truly want to see the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and build a \"peaceful world without nuclear weapons\", there will be no reason for them to turn down the just demand of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If such security guarantee comes true, the DPRK will also take steps in response to it and a decisive breakthrough will be made in realizing the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking this opportunity, the DPRK warns Park Geun Hye and other south Korean authorities not to play trickery any more to seek loopholes crying out for \"denuclearization of the north\" in collusion with their master but face up to the present reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they desperately defy the principled demand of the DPRK, the latter's nukes will be further bolstered up both in quality and quantity and its capacity will reach its maximum. They should bear this in mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization on the Korean peninsula entirely hinges on the attitude and behavior of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities."

It is a wound that never healed. The path to finding that closure will open only when North Korean and U.S. leaders decide to pursue this humanitarian mission other than their political differences.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the 66th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War on June 24, three members of the House of Representatives of U.S. Congress who are Korean War veterans submitted to the House of Representatives a resolution in their joint name demanding the U.S. government immediately come out for talk with North Korea to confirm the identities of GIs who died or remain unaccounted for during the Korean War and to bring back their remains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that incumbent lawmakers and NGOs in the U.S. are taking the administration to the task for the resumption of the recovery mission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the excavation of remains of GIs within the territory of the DPRK was started as a humanitarian measure taken by the DPRK at repeated earnest request made by the U.S. administration, the Korean War veterans and bereaved families to finally settle the issue of the identification of missing and unaccounted Korean War veterans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time it was a thing totally beyond imagination to excavate and send the remains of U.S. imperialist aggressors who inflicted unspeakable misfortune and pain on the Korean people in the past Fatherland Liberation War and, furthermore, it was a thing that could not be allowed for soldiers of hostile country to go about in the territory of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the army and people of the DPRK, taking into consideration the ardent desire of bereaved families to have even the remains of their kinsmen who met deaths in the Korean War be buried in their native places, rendered cooperation for the smooth excavation on more than 30 occasions for nearly ten years since 1996, with magnanimity from humanitarian stand, though the DPRK-U.S. relations were acute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Members from the U.S. side who had taken part in the joint excavation repeatedly expressed gratitude for the humanitarian measure and active cooperation rendered by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, afterwards the U.S. totally denied the sincere efforts made by the DPRK and the minds of bereaved families of those who took part in the war and unilaterally suspended the excavation work under the pretext of \"threat to security\" and went so impudent as to abuse such humanitarian issues as the excavation of remains for meeting Washington's political purpose on several occasions and tried to shift the blame for the suspension of the excavation work on to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In September 2014 the then U.S. Defense Secretary Hagel made groundless assertion at a memorial ceremony for the \"day of POWs and missing persons\" that \"the resumption of the excavation of remains depends on North Korea's implementation of the resolutions of UN Security Council\" even though he said \"it is the firm stand of the government never to forget missing GIs, find out them to the last man and let them come to the fold of their families\". Military authorities including a spokesperson for the Defense Department maintained that the \"North Korean government's provocative act is the reason for the suspension of the excavation of remains\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment the U.S. administration is making sophism that the resumption is only possible when North Korea stops provocation and shows its will to follow through on the UN Security Council's resolutions and there is ensuing improvement in the bilateral relations, while shelving Washington's responsibility for disrupting the excavation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is natural that Americans can not favor the attitude of the administration which always finds fault with others while abusing even humanitarian issue for meeting its political purposes, being obsessed by inveterate repugnance and hostility toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not care whether the U.S., a party directly concerned with the excavation work of remains of GIs who had become forlorn wandering spirit, is interested in the resumption of the excavation or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is mistaken if it thinks it can resume the excavation work at its will now as it suspended the work unilaterally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no sleight of hand can the U.S. evade from the responsibility for disrupting such humanitarian work as the excavation of remains of GIs, while pursuing its hideous hostile policy toward the DPRK."

Ltd. in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ship had been impounded in Tuxpan Port of Mexico since January last year due to the unreasonable decision that it was \"subject to freeze of properties\" for being owned and controlled by the Ocean Maritime Management Co. Ltd. on the list of the UN Security Council \"sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We already clarified several times by citing concrete facts that the ship can never be put on the list of \"sanctions\" and \"property freeze\" as it is the legitimate property of our company. But the 1718 Committee of the UNSC repeatedly requested the Mexican government not to allow the departure of the ship, asserting it is on the list of \"sanctions\", and this led to the scrapping of the ship in the end. The only \"reason\" for holding the ship was \"resolutions\" of the UN Security Council which are in violation of the spirit and requirements of the UN Charter and relevant conventions and which are unreasonable as they lack any legal ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our company, therefore, vehemently denounces the long-term impounding of the civilian ship as a wanton encroachment upon our legitimate right to own the ship, while considering all the ensuing losses and damage as the product of the U.S.-led hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All members and sailors of our company who had been engaged in peaceable and legitimate non-governmental business activities have suffered untold spiritual and socio-economic losses due to the illegal \"sanctions resolutions\" of the UNSC and the unreasonable holding of the ship, pursuant to them and this has done great harm to the living of individual families.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All this clearly proves the hypocrisy and double-dealing attitude of the U.S. and its followers crying out for defending \"human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We solemnly declare that we will certainly have all spiritual and material losses and damages inflicted upon us by unreasonable U.S.-manipulated UN \"resolutions\" paid and have the right to claim indemnity generation after generation."

            "content": "EE.UU. es responsable de destruccion de excavacion de restos mortales de tropas norteamericanas\r\nPyongyang, 6 de julio (ACNC) -- Kim Nam Hyok, investigador del Instituto para Asuntos Norteamericanos del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, hizo publica el dia 6 un comentario siguiente:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, se escuchan en el suelo norteamericano las voces que demandan la reanudacion de la excavacion de los restos mortales de uniformados norteamericanos caidos, trabajo interrumpido en el suelo de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un seminario sostenido el 23 de junio en la Universidad George Washington de Estados Unidos, Bill Richardson, ex gobernador de New Mexico, el presidente de la coalicion de familiares de prisioneros y desaparecidos del tiempo de la guerra coreana y la fria, etc. dijeron que la excavacion de los restos mortales de uniformados norteamericanos puede cumplir un rol importante en la mejora de relaciones EE.UU.-RPDC, deviene una herida no cicatrizada el que no trajeron los restos mortales de miles de militares desaparecidos en Norte de Corea durante la pasada guerra coreana (1950-1953) y puede ser un remedio bueno la realizacion de la excavacion por los organos civiles en vez de los organos gubernamentales. Y exigieron al gobierno prestar una atencion activa a la reanudacion del trabajo en cuestion dejando atras las diferencias politicas con el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, con motivo del 66o aniversario del estallido de la guerra coreana los 3 miembros de la camara de representantes norteamericana quienes habian participado en la pasada guerra coreana, presentaron el dia 24 en nombre comun a la Camara de Representantes una resolucion demandando al gobierno estadounidense dar inicio pronto al dialogo con el Norte de Corea para confirmar la identidad de los soldados norteamericanos muertos o desparecidos en esa contienda y recuperar sus restos mortales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es causal el que los parlamentarios en activo y las entidades civiles de EE.UU. exigen a su administracion la responsabilidad relacionada con el problema de la reanudacion de excavacion de los restos mortales de sus militares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOriginalmente, el trabajo de desenterrar los restos mortales norteamericanos en el territorio de la RPDC fue la labor comenzada por las medidas humanitarias de la RPDC que acepto la repetida y ardiente peticion de la administracion norteamericana, los participantes en la guerra coreana y los familiares de los soldados muertos de solucionar definitivamente el problema de los desparecidos uniformados norteamericanos quienes perecieron en la pasada guerra coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquel tiempo fue inimaginable el trabajo de desenterrar y devolver los restos mortales de los agresores yanquis que en el periodo de la pasada Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria dieron incontables desgracias y sufrimientos al pueblo coreano. En particular, fue intolerable la misma entrada de los militares del pais enemigo en el territorio de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, tomando en consideracion el ardiente deseo de familiares de buscar los restos mortales de sus consanguineos muertos en la guerra coreana y enterrarlos en sus tierras natales, el ejercito y el pueblo coreanos dispensaron una magnanimidad partiendo de la posicion humanitaria aun en medio de la tirantes relaciones entre la RPDC y EE.UU. de aquel entonces y brindaron una estrechada cooperacion para que se efectuaran sin dificultades las excavaciones en mas de 30 ocasiones durante casi 10 anos desde 1996.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos miembros de la parte norteamericana, que habian participado en la obra de excavacion conjunta en aquel entonces, expresaron en reiteradas veces el agradecimiento por las medidas humanitarias y la cooperacion activa brindadas por la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, EE.UU. interrumpio unilateralmente las labores de excavacion de restos mortales despreciando totalmente los esfuerzos sinceros de la RPDC y la aspiracion de los familiares de los participantes muertos en la guerra y pretextando alguna \"amenaza de seguridad\". Ademas, en varias ocasiones abuso cinicamente de los asuntos humanitarios como la excavacion de restos mortales en la realizacion de su objetivo politico, e intento imputar a la RPDC la responsabilidad del cese del trabajo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una actividad conmemorativa del \"Dia de los presos y desaparecidos de guerra\" realizada en septiembre de 2014, Hagel, ex secretario de Defensa, dijo que \"es la firme posicion del gobierno no olvidar a los militares norteamericanos desaparecidos y buscarlos hasta el fin para devolverlos al regazo de sus familias\" y peroro las absurdas insistencias en que el \"reinicio de la excavacion de restos mortales depende de la ejecucion de la resolucion del Consejo de la Seguridad de la ONU por parte del Norte de Corea\". Le sumaron el vocero del Departamento de Defensa y otras autoridades de la capa militar estadounidense senalando que \"los actos provocativos del gobierno del Norte de Corea devienen el motivo de la paralisis de la excavacion de restos mortales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta este momento, la administracion norteamericana, al dejar a un lado su responsabilidad de la ruptura del descubrimiento de restos mortales del ejercito norteamericano, pronuncia sofisterias de que podra reiniciar las labores de excavacion de restos mortales solo cuando el Norte de Corea muestre la voluntad de cesar las provocaciones y observar la resolucion arriba mencionada y se logre asi una mejora en las relaciones bilaterales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor tanto, a los estadounidenses no les gustaria la actitud de su administracion que cautivada por el sentimiento negativo y hostil contra la RPDC, provoca siempre a la contraparte abusandose hasta de los asuntos humanitarios en el cumplimiento del objeto politico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no hace caso a que EE.UU., dueno de restos mortales de militares norteamericanos, tenga interes o no en el reinicio de esas labores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera una gran equivocacion si EE.UU. piensa que podria reiniciar como quiera la excavacion de restos mortales interrumpida por el mismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no podra liberarse con ninguna artimana de la responsabilidad de haber frustrado hasta las labores humanitarias como el descubrimiento de los restos mortales del ejercito norteamericano persiguiendo la peor politica hostil a la RPDC."

Pero, el es el responsable que acarrea el sustancial peligro de guerra mediante los incesantes incrementos de armas y entrenamientos en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. no quiere la derrota tragica en la confrontacion total con la RPDC, debe hacer una seria opcion al ver correctamente la posicion estrategica de la RPDC y la epoca en cambio."
