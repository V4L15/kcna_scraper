Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary assailing the United States for massively reinforcing armed forces in South Korea for a war against the DPRK under the pretext of the Yugoslav crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. urgently sent 12 of 18 F-15E fighter-bombers,  and armed forces over 200 strong including pilots to the Kwangju  airfield of South Korea.  They had been expected to be deployed there under the plea of filling up \"security vacuum\" caused by the recent dispatch of its aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk to Persian gulf.  And two AC-130 ground attack planes were additionally deployed to support the U.S. forces in South Korea while two wings comprising over 30 F-18 fighter planes and five B-52 strategic bombers in the U.S. mainland were put on standby alert.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such steps, which can be seen only on the eve of war, indicate that the U.S. seeks to ignite a war against the DPRK at any moment, the commentary says, and goes on:   The South Korean authorities, who seek a way out of the grave political and economic crisis in provoking an anti-north war, are scheming to purchase airplanes of the latest type from France to step up arms buildup, taking advantage of the U.S. war moves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The facts clearly show that the U.S. and South Korean war hawks have made it a fait accompli to unleash the second Korean war of aggression.

In order to realize their brigandish ambition, the South Korean rulers enacted on January 20, 1962 a \"special measure law on five provinces in the north\" that \"legalized\" the \"recovery\" of the provinces in the northern half of Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the \"offices for five provinces in the north\" are playing the role of a shock-brigade in anti-north confrontation, the white paper points out:   The offices' history is woven with criminal anti-north confrontation.\r\n   Their preoccupation has been distortion, fabrication, smear campaign and sabotage and conspiratorial moves against all things in the North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whenever an opportunity presented itself, they kicked up anti-communist and anti-north rackets by sponsoring \"meetings to renew their resolution\" and undertaking a \"signature campaign\" against the North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey printed the monthly \"information on north\" and other publications which carry all sorts of forged materials to sling mud at the socialist system in the north and distributed them.   They have virulently challenged national unity and the cause of reunification.\r\n   In a bid to freeze the national division, the offices defined it as their main job to block the inter-Korean dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the first full-dress talks were due in Pyongyang after the successful talks between the red cross societies of the north and the south, they included the \"chairman of the national association of people from five provinces in the north\" in the delegation as an \"advisory member\", in a bid to lay an artificial hurdle in the way of talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the time of the exchange of art troupes and home-visiting groups between the north and the south in the middle of the 1980s, they included wicked anti-communist elements there in an attempt to create a confusion.   The offices made themselves infamous by obstructing justifiable activities of pro-reunification patriots and democratic personages in South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whenever the ruling system in South Korea was hit hard by political crisis, the offices sponsored \"rallies to denounce\" the north at which they incited north-south confrontation and thus spearheaded the campaign intended to create a political atmosphere to suppress reunification-oriented people's movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing to the despicable tie-up between the present authorities and the offices, the white paper continues.   The offices are a leftover of the long standing anti-communist and anti-north confrontation.   The tie-up and cooperation between the present South Korean authorities and the offices are prompted by their common intention to persistently pursue a showdown with the North Korea and extend the \"system of liberal democracy\" to the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As long as these offices, which have been indulged in anti-communist and anti-north criminal moves for the last five decades, are left intact it is impossible to improve the north-south relations or terminate the north-south confrontation.\r\n   These offices in South Korea must be dismantled unconditionally. \r\n   They will have to pay dearly for the crimes they have committed against the nation. \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang, part of non-governmental economic cooperation between the DPRK and Hyundai Business Group of South Korea, over the issue related to the ship \"Hyundai Phungak.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said:   The issue of the ship \"Hyundai Phungak\" was caused by the Hyundai Business Group as it unilaterally decided and allowed the departure of the ship before getting formal permission from us after the presentation of a list of tourists and also before arrangements were made to receive the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, a large number of tourists aboard the ship \"Phungak\" had to wait at sea near the Military Demarcation Line for more ten hours.   The entry of the ship, anyhow, was allowed and tourists could have a tour of Mt. Kumgang, though belatedly, thanks to our generosity and sincere efforts.   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities distorted the fact and are getting overheated in anti-north confrontation campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They, who have hindered the tour of Mt.

The \"Phungak\" issue is totally a matter raised between us and the Hyundai group and the South Korean authorities have no ground to meddle in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should immediately discontinue such moves as instigating the fellow countrymen to confrontation, in disregard of the desire and will of the north, the Hyundai group and the South Korean people.
