It has resolutely defended the security of the country and socialist gains and firmly guaranteed the victorious advance of the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms while frustrating every move of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges to provoke a war, standing on the forefront of the anti-imperialist military front. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Songun politics being pursued by the WPK is the politics which calls for regarding the military affairs as the most important state affair and carrying out all work related to the revolution and construction in a revolutionary and militant manner with the People's Army as a core and main force.

He aqui precisamente la originalidad y el poderio invencible de la politica de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy, el EPC, que crecio como poderosas fuerzas armadas revolucionarias dispuestas de todos los medios modernos para el ataque y la defensa capaces de frustrar de un golpe cualquier invasion armada de los enemigos, logra triunfos prodigiosos en el enconado enfrentamiento antiimperialista y anti-EE.UU. y la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea muestra su gallardo aspecto de potencia militar de talla mundial que posee el disuasivo de guerra de caracter autodefensivo. Esto es el precioso resultado de la destacada y probada direccion del Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los militantes del partido, los oficiales y soldados del EPC y los habitantes deben defender en lo politico e ideologico y a costa de la vida al Dirigente Kim Jong Il en cualesquier vicisitudes y consolidar ferreamente la unidad monolitica entre el partido, el ejercito y el pueblo cuyo centro es la Direccion de la Revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Hay que establecer estrictamente el sistema de mando militar y el estilo militar revolucionarios, segun los cuales todos los oficiales y soldados del EPC se mueven unanimemente a la orden del Comandante Supremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es preciso seguir realizando ingentes esfuerzos por el desarrollo de la industria de defensa nacional segun la demanda de la linea de la construccion economica socialista de la epoca del Songun en el principio de dar prioridad a los asuntos militares, realizar en un nivel mas alto la modernizacion de todo el ejercito y el armamento de todo el pueblo y convertir todo el pais en un baluarte inexpugnable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Dado que continuan la politica hostil y las maniobras agresivas de los yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos contra la RPDC, fortaleceremos mas y mas el disuasivo de guerra para defender la dignidad del pais y el derecho a la existencia de la nacion y tomaremos las contramedidas mas duras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si las fuerzas belicistas de EE.UU. y la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak se atreven a desatar la guerra de agresion pese a las reiteradas advertencias nuestras, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea les responderan con la gran guerra de reunificacion justa rotunda e implacable, exterminaran a los agresores usando toda la potencialidad militar y cumpliran sin  falta la historica causa de reunificacion de la patria."
