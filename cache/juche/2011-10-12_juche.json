It made an excuse that the criminal was overdrunken. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Did the ceaseless sexual assaults occur by \"mistakes\"? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The incidents were not accidental ones committed by individual lechers. They are an inevitable outcome of the U.S. military presence and colonial rule over south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is a bloodstained history of crimes, as they have brought immeasurable misfortunes and disasters to the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not a single day has passed in south Korea without plunder, murder, rape and violence since the U.S. forces occupied it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bestial atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops against south Korean women, in particular, are unprecedented in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their atrocities that make all Koreans shudder include the hair-cutting of a woman in Tongduchon, painting of a woman in Uijongbu, sexual assault against a six-year-old girl, murder of Yun Kum I and the killing of two schoolgirls Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son. These atrocities committed by murderers and lechers without parallels made even animals blush. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such atrocities are repeating themselves still now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the south Korean authorities dodged the probe into the truth about those cases and handed the GI criminals to the U.S. forces side without detaining or punishing them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors have been so cruel towards fellow countrymen but are conniving at the GI crimes, submissive to the U.S. while keeping mum about its barbarities.

But this is nothing but a deceptive trick to cover up its true colors as an unheard-of manslaughter and chieftain of immorality and calm down the people's grievances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as south Korea remains the U.S. colony and the humiliating south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement\" exists, the crimes by the U.S. troops will never cease. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group of traitors are scheming to hush up the recent case, obedient to the U.S. under the pretext of \"alliance.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality clearly proves that young people, girls in particular, can neither bring into bloom their desire for learning nor evade as miserable fate as Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son as long as the puppet group of sycophantic traitors are allowed to stay in power in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean society, where traitors lord it over under the jack boots of the outsiders, calls on the youth and students loving justice and patriotism to the sacred struggle for independence, democracy and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the south Korean youth and students should turn out in the nationwide struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, chieftain of aggression and massacre, out of south Korea at once, put an end to the U.S. military occupation and colonial rule and wipe out despicable sycophantic traitors serving the U.S."

On the contrary, the SOFA grants the U.S. side only the right to bring appeal in a court. This is the essence of the agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is due to the shackling SOFA that the GIs' crimes are on the steady increase and victims are suffering pains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The release urged the U.S. to immediately make apology for the sexual assaults, take measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents and revise the SOFA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. fails to accept the demand of the people, it would meet the same nation-wide candle-light resistance as in 2002 after the killing of two girl students, the release warned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The participants in the conference staged demonstration holding slogan boards reading \"U.S. president, apologize for sexual assaults by GIs in south Korea\", \"U.S., take measures to end GIs' crimes against women\" and \"Revise unequal SOFA at once\"."
