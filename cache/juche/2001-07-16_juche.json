Then the chief for Asia-Pacific of the safeguards department of the IAEA asserted that \"North Korea's refusal to allow IAEA's full inspection may adversely affect the LWR provision to North Korea\" and that \"verification needs to be finished before the start of the provision of LWR major parts.\" This showed once again a partial behaviour and criminal attempt of the IAEA to shift the responsibility for the non-compliance with the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework onto the DPRK at any cost as their remarks were timed to coincide with Bush's announcement of the U.S. unilateral and conditional \"policy toward the DPRK\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clarified in the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework that the agency shall have negotiations on the verification of accuracy and perfection of the initial report on nuclear material with the DPRK after the completion of a considerable part of the lwr project and before the delivery of major nuclear-related parts and shall implement the safeguards agreement according to their outcome. However, some members of the IAEA made such remarks quite contrary to the AF. These were let loose by them not because of their ignorance about the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their assertions were misinterpretation of the AF. Early verification and inspection are still under debate among senior officials of the IAEA though the prospect of the controversial lwr project remains dim and the DPRK is, in fact, suffering a huge economic loss due to its delay. This proves that the IAEA is playing into the hands of the U.S. dancing to its tune. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Talking about verification and inspection under this situation is in diametrical contravention of the AF. The DPRK, therefore, can never accept them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the IAEA is to remain true to its mission and principle as an international body, it is well advised not to resort to such practice as ditching the AF, following the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK but to take the united states to task for delaying the LWR project and put pressure upon it to complete it by the target period.    \r\n\r\n"

It is against this backdrop that the DPRK is urging the U.S. to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its moves for a war of aggression and opt for improving relations with the DPRK. However, the U.S. says as if the DPRK seeks a sort of \"agreement\" through the improved bilateral relations. moreover, the U.S. considers the resumption of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and improved relations to be a \"benefit\" it may bring to the DPRK. That is why it is talking such nonsense that it will not reach any \"thoughtless agreement\" with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the DPRK does not want any improvement of relations while allowing the dignity of the nation and the sovereign right of the country to be infringed upon. The DPRK will never opt to meet the u.s. demand for improved relations nor bow and beg the U.S. for any \"agreement.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to ensure impartiality and equality and reciprocate good faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. gives up its hostile policy toward the DPRK and properly approaches the dialogue, the DPRK will respond to it with good faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to make a proper option, clearly mindful that its relations with the DPRK can never improve unless it drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

The army-first politics which requires all problems to be solved on the principle of giving priority to military affairs proved to be the most powerful and just mode of politics in the DPRK that has wrought miraculous victories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the army-first politics, he demonstrated to the world that a powerful army helps frustrate any isolation and stifling moves by the imperialists and boost the dull economy and put it on the track of steady development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Isolation, nuclear threats and missile fuss by the imperialists became impotent before the army-first politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-first politics guarantees victory at present and in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive nature of the imperialists remains unchanged and their dominationist policy is being more intensified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under these circumstances, all countries and nations aspiring after independence should pursue army-first politics in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By so doing, a nation is able to defend its sovereignty and dignity and successfully step up the people's cause of independence, the socialist cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-first politics is invincible.    \r\n\r\n"
