This is attributable to the fact that the \"government\" has put pressure upon the north, focusing everything on the denuclearization of the north with a single mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same can be said of the fact that south Korea raised the north's apology for the \"Cheonan\" and Yonphyong Island cases as preconditions for the south-north dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the \"government\" should preferentially do in this respect is to readjust the environment around south Korea such as humble self-reflection on the policy pursued toward the north so far and censure of those involved. The stand of passing the buck on the north only would just make our stance further shrink.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, south Korea will enter into the phase of presidential election at the end of the year. We are too short of time to shape a new policy toward the north and push it forward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An immediate duty of the \"government\" is, therefore, to manage the present situation in a stable manner on the basis of self-reflection and create a phase of dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"government\" should immediately get rid of the shock and comprehensively reexamine the policy toward the north."
