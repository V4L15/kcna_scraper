            "content": "CPRK Secretariat Flails S. Korea's War Exercises\r\nPyongyang, November 12 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet regime kicked off an anti-DPRK war rehearsal, 2014 Hoguk, throughout south Korea on Monday in the plea of \"annual exercises\".\n\t\t\t\t\tTaking part in the large-scale military rehearsal to be staged till November 21 are at least 330,000 troops, more than four times those involved in the past, and 23,000 pieces of mobile equipment, 60 warships and various kinds of aircraft. During the rehearsal they will conduct such military drills as \"frontline corps' drill for carrying out operation plan\", \"drill for defending northwestern islands\", \"naval drill for infiltration into coast\" and \"combined landing drill\". And they will reportedly stage several joint exercises with the U.S. imperialist aggression forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued its information bulletin No. 1079 on Tuesday, which said the rehearsal is a preliminary war, nuclear test war for aggression on the DPRK in light of its scale and content.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean puppet warmongers assert that the rehearsal is \"aimed to establish the strictest military posture against someone's provocation\", the bulletin pointed out, saying:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group had much talked about \"high-level contact\" until recently but unilaterally scuppered it. And now it is staging the Hoguk rehearsal in the largest scale. This clearly proved that the south Korean authorities do not hope for dialogue in actuality but has attempted to use it as a camouflage in order to escalate confrontation and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality shows that the south Korean puppet group is only keen on anti-DPRK war exercises, making in succession \"local provocations\" and crying out that they will not rule out a total war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the rehearsal, the group seeks to justify the criminal indefinite extension of the transfer of the right to wartime operation control, raise its troops' morale sagged due to serious breaches of military discipline and use them as a shock brigade for igniting a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe out the south Korean puppet forces if they provoke the DPRK even a bit."
