Paektu and all the potentials built in the crucible of the Songun revolution and thus mete out a stern punishment to the aggressors and surely accomplish the historic cause of national reunification."

Prior to this, the group conducted a search, seizure and arrest operation against those students who presented reunification-related papers to the seminar sponsored by a civic and public organization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The organizations including the above-said headquarters, the South Side Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration and the \"National Federation of Peasants Associations\" and their members that became targets of suppression are staunch pro-reunification patriotic organizations and patriotic figures as they have worked harder than anyone for the independence of the south Korean society and the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whirlwind of wholesale suppression of the pro-reunification patriotic forces launched by the group is nothing but a treacherous move to completely put down the movement for reunification daily mounting in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group sentenced leading members of the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration to heavy penalties after labeling it an \"enemy-benefiting organization\" in the wake of its suppression of the south Korean Council of Youth Organizations at the outset of the year. The whirlwind of arrest kicked up by the group again this time indicates that its operation is being conducted in a premeditated manner to eliminate the forces supporting the June 15 declaration, the pro-reunification patriotic forces in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through this repressive campaign the Lee group seeks to weather its worst ruling crisis and further escalate the confrontation with the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group kicked off such frantic repressive campaign after groundlessly labeling the above-said organizations \"pro-north leftist forces praising the north's system and receiving instructions from it.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's anti-reunification fascist offensive is a blatant challenge to the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for its implementation, and an act of treachery blocking national reconciliation and unity and throwing a big stumbling block in the way of implementing the cause of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the group is allowed to go on with such repressive offensive, it will result in stifling all the forces supporting the June 15 joint declaration and the progressive organizations for the reunification movement and the prospect of improving the inter-Korean relations will get gloomier. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-reunification fascist elements should be thrown overboard as they do not wish to see reconciliation and unity among the fellow countrymen and independent reunification."
