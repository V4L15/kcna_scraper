He highly appreciated their successful performance and extended thanks to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the soldiers have firmly prepared themselves politically and ideologically and in military technique and grown to be an army strong in idea and faith with high cultural entertainments, he said, adding that no force on earth can match such army ready to go through thick and thin for the sake of the party and the leader, the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the 31st art festival of servicepersons of the KPA is a striking demonstration of the validity and vitality of the WPK's literary and art policy on popularizing art and the praiseworthy culture of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The soldier culture created by the KPA is pervaded with the spirit of the times and militant optimism and rich emotion and it has become an example of socialist cultured practice in the era of Songun and a genuine model for all the officials and other working people to follow, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that it is an effective means for increasing the combat capability of the unit to energetically conduct the revolutionary art activities in the army, he set forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for further developing the popular art activities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is evidenced by the facts that he urged lawmakers to oppose the above-said agreement and some congressmen from the Republican Party were of the view that they would not approve the expenses for the provision of heavy fuel oil to the DPRK requested by the administration and conservatives of the administration claimed that a stick should be applied to north Korea in case it fails to keep its promise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As universally known, the agreements adopted at the six-party talks stipulate the commitments to be fulfilled by the participants in the talks for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Earnest talks are now under way between the DPRK and the U.S. in various fields including bilateral working-level talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. supply of heavy fuel oil to the DPRK is going on at the phase of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, U.S. conservative hard-liners are keen to have the above-said agreement scrapped and deter the U.S. administration from implementing it. This is a clear indication that they do not wish to see the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but only pursue a stand-off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the conservative hard-liners are doing will only invite the international community's censure as it is nothing but an anachronistic and base act of those who swim against the trend of the times toward detente over the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, AP accused Bolton of working hard to scrap the agreement adopted at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hard-liners would be well advised to behave themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. It remains unchanged in its sincere efforts to achieve this aim.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

New revolutionary dramas have been created to enrich the Juche-oriented revolutionary drama art in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time, the world drama circle thought that it was inevitable for the drama with long history to fall into decay and ruin as movies were widely disseminated and TV found its way to houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On November 7, Juche 61 (1972) Kim Jong Il authored the famous work \"On Creating a New Revolutionary Drama that Meets the Juche Era\". He in the work indicated the very way for creating new revolutionary dramas suitable to the emotion and aesthetic sense of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He heralded the drama revolution with the representation of the famous drama \"A Mountain Shrine\" created by President Kim Il Sung in the period of his early revolutionary activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days he gave scientific answers to the theoretic and practical issues arising in creation of revolutionary drama such as theme, composition and aspect of drama, introduction of music and song to drama, stereo of stage art, conversion of stage without letup and thus created a model of the Korean style revolutionary drama. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his guidance brilliant successes were made in creating such famous works as \"Blood at an International Conference\", \"A Letter from a Daughter\", \"Three Pretenders\" and \"A Celebration Meeting\" in the form of \"A Mountain Shrine\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The creation of \"A Mountain Shrine\"-type drama was the great event opening the new era of Juche-oriented revolutionary drama and constituted a landmark for the construction of Juche-oriented drama art and the development of the world drama. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the Workers' Party of Korea's policy and theory on drama art advanced in the creation of the \"A Mountain Shrine\"-style dramas, masterpieces including the revolutionary dramas \"Under the Banner of Victory,\" \"Wish\" and \"Mother's Request\" were created one by one.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

When developing the extra large bomb capable of penetrating deep underground, the U.S. did not conceal that it was designed to strike the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from all this, we may say that the U.S. is hastening preparations to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK at the last stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various types of U.S. battleships are frequenting Japanese ports near the Korean Peninsula. This suggests that the sinister U.S. scheme to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK is entering the practical stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. eagerly waits for an opportunity to launch a preemptive strike while pretending to seek reconciliation with the DPRK, the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. will never be settled and the situation will get more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The option of preemptive strike is not a monopoly of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans who live separated in the two parts are committed to achieving national reunification, their common will and interests, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is, in essence, the cause of achieving national independence as it is aimed at putting an end to foreign domination and interference and attaining national independence. It is the task to be fulfilled for the sake of the Korean nation. The Koreans in the north and the south and overseas have a vital interests in it, in reality. More than six decades have passed since Korea was divided into two by outside forces. National reunification has, therefore, become the cherished desire of the Koreans. It represents the will of the nation and its implementation would meet its vital interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When handling any national issue, the issue of inter-Korean relations, Koreans should regard the unity and reunification of the nation, its will and interests, as a standard for settling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They can never achieve independence by depending upon outside forces in settling the national issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification proved in practice that neither relations with any foreign forces nor ism should be placed above the interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans who stake their destiny on national reunification should solve all issues on the principle of defending the nation and giving priority to it, regarding its will and interests as an absolute standard in order to achieve independence. There can be no other way for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans are the driving force for national reunification and no one can replace them in this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are called upon to regard the common will and interests of the nation as the best standard under any circumstances and carve out their destiny independently by resolutely rejecting the foreign interference and pressure according to their own view and judgement in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It seeks to nominally disorganize the \"command\" through the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations\" and, instead, use other military mechanism more powerful than it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. still remains unchanged in its intention to perpetuate its military presence in south Korea and realize its design for domination over the whole of Korea. This is proved by the fact that the U.S. is working hard to maintain and reinforce the \"UN Command\" in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, there will be no change even if the \"Combined Forces Command\" is dissolved through the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations.\" The \"Combined Forces Command\" and the \"UN Command\" are different in name, but much the same in intrinsic nature as they serve as a criminal military tool for occupation, domination, aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that either dissolution of the \"command\" or transfer of the \"right\" will be nothing but a gimcrack as long as the U.S. forces remain in south Korea.

En el senalo que algunas personalidades de la Administracion norteamericana hacen \"diplomacia absurda\" con la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tales palabras no valen nada siendo refunfunos del hombre expulsado del gobierno. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Tambien no pasa de ser un aullido desesperado para danar a toda costa la imagen de la RPDC que aprecia la promesa y la confianza. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El problema reside en que Bolton y otras fuerzas conservadoras intransigentes yanquis maniobran obstinadamente para frustrar el acuerdo de las conversaciones a 6 partes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bolton \"llama\" a los parlamentarios a oponerse al citado acuerdo; unos congresistas republicanos expresaron la posicion de \"no aprobar los gastos concernientes al ofrecimiento del aceite pesado de la administracion a la RPDC\" y las fuerzas conservadoras de la administracion dijeron que \"si el Norte de Corea no cumple su promesa, debe aplicar el latigo\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como es notorio por todos, los acuerdos aprobados en la cita a 6 bandas aclaran los deberes de los paises participantes en esta a ser cumplidos por la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ahora, la RPDC y EE.UU. efectuan con sinceridad las conversaciones de expertos y otros dialogos en varias esferas. Tambien, se impulsa en etapa practica el ofrecimiento del aceite pesado de EE.UU. a Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A pesar de esto, las fuerzas conservadoras intransigentes de EE.UU. tratan de convertir en un papel mojado el mismo acuerdo de las conversaciones a 6 bandas y detener la accion de la administracion norteamericana para el cumplimiento del acuerdo, lo cual demuestra fehacientemente que ellas no desean la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana  sino persiguen solo el enfrentamiento. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tales maniobras causaran solo la censura de la sociedad internacional siendo actos viejos y viles de quienes no agradan la corriente de la epoca hacia el alivio de tension en torno al problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No es casual que la AP comento que \"Bolton se esfuerza por llevar al fracaso el acuerdo de las conversaciones a 6 bandas\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las fuerzas conservadoras intransigentes de EE.UU. deben actuar con prudencia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Son invariables la posicion de la RPDC de realizar la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y sus sinceros  esfuerzos por llevarla a cabo.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
