He often dropped in at houses of working people to take warm care of their living, even opening the lid of rice-cooking pot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every nook and corner of Korea, from deep mountainous village to a solitary islet village, is associated with his traces of love.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To the President, the people were his beloved sons and daughters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the sake of those, he worked hard without having rest in red-letter days and even in his birthday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is natural that the Korean people called him \"our leader\" and \"fatherly leader\" and are still holding him in high esteem as the \"eternal President\" and the \"eternal father\"."
