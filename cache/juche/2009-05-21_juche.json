This cannot be construed otherwise than a very grave development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Incumbent Prime Minister Aso strong in the rightist tendency has frequently denied the past history of aggression before and after he took office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently he described the Pacific war ignited by the Japanese imperialists as the \"greater East Asia war.\" Under the Aso regime the textbook for secondary schoolers distorting history passed through the government's screening on April 9.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said history textbook describes the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592 as \"dispatch of troops\", not as aggression, and the Pacific war as the \"greater East Asia war.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Militarism has already become a main source of Asian aggression in Japan influenced by the rightist conservative political view as it has a dangerous political and military impact, far from remaining a departed soul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years the Japanese Diet has deliberated and adopted various kinds of military laws and regulations or revised ones almost every year, thus establishing in the main a legal system including a legislation for wartime mobilization. As a result, the conversion of Japan into a military power has already become part of the state strategic system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has steadily increased the military spending and developed highly scientific and technological equipment, thereby bolstering up the \"Self-Defense Forces\" as the armed forces fully capable of conducting operations and fighting a real war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan dispatched destroyers of the \"Maritime Self-Defense Force\" to the waters off Somalia on the basis of the enlarged interpretation of the \"law on SDF\" under the pretext of performing its \"international duty\" and \"ensuring the security\" in the international sea route. On May 18 it sent an advance party to dispatch P-3C of the MSDF there in a bid to get it start fulfilling its real duty overseas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military muscle of Japan is rapidly increasing as it has already grown strong as a result of huge military spending and the backing of the rightist forces at home.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear that militarist Japan may launch reinvasion any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of Japan's veer to Right lies in the revival of militarism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revived Japanese militarism, the second war force, may plunge not only Asia but the rest of the world into a horrible war disaster again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the reason why the international community should heighten the vigilance against the rightist trend of thought in Japan and strictly guard against it."

            "content": "ATCC comenta la corriente derechista de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 21 de mayo (ATCC) -- En estos tiempos, Japon es contagiado de la tendencia derechista y conservadora.\n\t\t\t\t\t  El tema de la visita al \"Santuario Yasukuni\" es la muestra tipica de lo influyentes que son las fuerzas derechistas de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Partido Democratico Liberal, grupo ultraderechista, estipulo en su \"proyecto de orientacion de actividades\" del ano 2009 esta frase: \"daremos continuidad a la visita al  como responsable partido politico conservador\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ademas, insiste en que \"el mandatario japones debe seguir visitando a ese lugar porque expresar el respeto a los que murieron por el pais es su deber natural\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las fuerzas derechistas dentro del PDL instigan activamente la visita del premier al santuario hablando que \"esto es un asunto interno\" y \"tiene mucha importancia a pesar de la presion interna y externa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hace poco, el premier Aso envio ofrendas a su nombre al \"Santuario Yasukuni\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Y el ex premier Abe dijo el 11 de mayo que \"hace falta dar el ambiente para la visita publica del premier al \".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En ese pais isleno se pronuncian sin escrupulos los disparates militaristas y son toleradas tacitamente y amparadas las locuras de las fracciones conservadoras ultraderechistas que niegan, tergiversan y elogian abiertamente la historia de agresiones del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Resulta un problema de capital importancia para ellos, que toman por su primera meta la militarizacion del pais, echar la firme base politica y militar para la agresion a ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo prioritario de ello es formar a muchos jovenes barbaros, que se encarguen de las futuras guerras de agresion, aprovechando el clima neofascista que se hace cada vez mas fuerte en toda la sociedad japonesa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy dia, crecen cada dia mas las influencias de las fuerzas derechistas de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los elementos conservadores derechistas, que emergieron como nucleo del circulo politico, encauzan la principal corriente politica y se desesperan por realizar sus rancias ambiciones, lo cual es peligrosisima evolucion de la situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Antes y despues de la toma del poder, Aso, figura de fuerte matiz derechista, vino negandose a la historia de agresiones del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recientemente, el describio la Guerra del Pacifico provocada por los imperialistas de su pais en el siglo pasado como la \"Guerra para la gran Asia Oriental\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el regimen de Aso, el manual para la escuela secundaria, que se redacto tergiversando la historia, paso el 9 de abril el examen del gobierno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En este libro la \"agresion de Japon a Corea en el ano Imjin (1592)\" fue interpretada como \"movilizacion de las tropas\" y la Guerra del Pacifico, como la \"guerra para la gran Asia Oriental\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En ese pais isleno imbuido de la concepcion politica ultraderechista y conservadora, el militarismo ya no es algo fantasmal sino el peligroso ente politico-militar que se convertira en el caudillo agresor de Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En los ultimos anos, la dieta japonesa abordo y aprobo casi todos los anos las reglas militares de diversos generos y los proyectos de enmienda, de modo que quedara establecido en lo fundamental el sistema legal, incluyendo la movilizacion en el tiempo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La conversion del pais en una potencia militar ya se hizo una parte del sistema estrategico estatal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Mientras tanto, las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" se convirtieron en las dotadas de gran capacidad operacional y combatividad gracias al constante aumento de gastos militares y al desarrollo de los equipos fabricados con la ciencia y tecnologia de punta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ademas, bajo el pretexto del cumplimiento de la \"responsabilidad internacional\" y la \"preservacion de la seguridad\" de rutas maritimas internacionales, Japon envio el buque escolta de las \"Fuerzas Maritimas de Autodefensa\" al mar frente a Somalia parafraseando a su manera la \"ley de las Fuerzas de Autodefensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Seguidamente, el 18 del mes en curso, partio al mismo destino la avanzada para posibilitar el despacho del \"P-3C\" de las \"Fuerzas Maritimas de Autodefensa\", la cual ya entro en el cumplimiento de su mision en ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estan en el proceso de expansion las fuerzas armadas de Japon que se han fortalecido gracias a los fabulosos gastos militares y por la instigacion de los ultraderechistas nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es indiscutible que Japon militarizado tomara en cualquier momento el camino de reagresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El renacimiento del militarismo, he aqui el caracter peligroso de la derechizacion de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es del todo posible que el resucitado militarismo japones, segunda fuerza belica, imponga otra vez los desastres de guerra a los pueblos asiaticos y del resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por esta razon, la sociedad internacional debe tomar precaucion especial de la corriente derechista de Japon."
