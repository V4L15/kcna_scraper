            "content": "National Meeting Celebrates Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Election as NDC Chairman \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture Tuesday to celebrate the 15th anniversary of General Secretary Kim Jong Il's election as chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were senior officials of the party, the army and the state including Kim Yong Nam, Kim Yong Il and Kim Yong Chun, chairpersons of friendly parties, officials of party and armed forces and power organs, public organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, officials in the fields of science, education, culture and arts, public health and media, labor innovators and working people in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Il, premier of the DPRK Cabinet, in a report made there said that Kim Jong Il's election as chairman of the NDC made it possible to successfully carry forward President Kim Il Sung's idea of self-reliant national defence upbuilding and his exploits and his unique cause of nation-building and provided a sure guarantee for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche started on Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past 15 years during which the DPRK has advanced, holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem as chairman of the NDC of the DPRK are shining as a sacred revolutionary course in the 60 year-long history of the DPRK as this period witnessed historic changes and signal victories in the cause of building a socialist state and building a rich and powerful country under the banner of the great Juche idea, the Songun idea, the reporter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il, on the basis of an insight into the requirements of the Korean revolution, formulated the Songun politics as a basic political mode under socialism and applied it in all fields of the revolution and construction, thus ushering in a new era of the Juche revolution, the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward the People's Army as a core force in achieving the single-minded unity and made sure that the servicepersons and people achieved the great unity between them based on unity in thinking and fighting spirit. He rallied the servicepersons and people around the party with warm love and devotion to them, regarding the people's mindset as a great foundation of the single-minded unity. He thus increased the might of the unity and cohesion of our revolutionary ranks in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Considering it the primary task of nation-building and activities to boost the nation's defence capability, Kim Jong Il has successfully materialized the Juche-oriented idea of national defence upbuilding and the line of building the revolutionary armed forces, thus remarkably increasing the might of the armed forces of the DPRK and consolidating the military position of our revolution as firm as an iron wall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il provided the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing the joint declaration in all fields, thus converting the north-south relations into those of reconciliation and cooperation and ushering in a new era of reunification in which the Koreans powerfully push forward the movement for national reunification in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and with the will to embody it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to his outstanding political caliber and preeminent external activities that the DPRK's dignity and influence have been further exalted on the international arena than ever before, its relations with other countries have rapidly gained in scope and strength and international solidarity with the Korean revolution has grown stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the tasks facing the Korean people at present, the reporter called for deeply grasping and defending Kim Jong Il's idea of national defence upbuilding and exploits performed by him and thoroughly implementing the Songun idea and line, regarding his Songun leadership exploits as guidelines, and thus increasing the might of the DPRK in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underlined the need for all Koreans to pool efforts, resolutely foil the outsiders' interference and the moves of the pro-U.S. sycophantic conservative ruling forces in south Korea for confrontation with the DPRK and wage a more dynamic struggle for independent reunification and peace and prosperity so as to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula still remains tense and unstable due to the U.S. invariable hostile policy toward the DPRK, the reporter said, declaring that the army and people of the DPRK are closely following the moves of the U.S. and its followers to stifle the DPRK with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and they will deal decisive and merciless blows at the slightest infringement upon the dignity and interests of the DPRK, a sovereign state.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The \"resolution,\" asserting that \"human rights are being systematically violated\" in the DPRK, totally rejected the Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses and decided to extend the tenure of office of a ghost-like special rapporteur one year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that the \"resolution\" adopted with Japan and EU being main players is aimed at intensifying their interference in the internal affairs of the dignified DPRK as it serves the U.S. purpose of stifling the DPRK by tarnishing its  image and increasing the international pressure on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is an unpardonable encroachment upon the DPRK, an independent and sovereign state, to dare interfere in its internal affairs under the pretext of \"human rights issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known, it is only those countries which incur the displeasure of the U.S. that have become targets of criticism over their human rights issues quite contrary to the principle of impartiality and objectivity, and the tendency of applying double standards and politicizing human rights has become more pronounced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the human rights are concerned, blame should be laid, first of all, on the U.S., the worst human rights violator in the world, which does not hesitate to commit terrorist acts against sovereign states, and Japan which has refused to make an apology and reparation for its past hideous crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, those accustomed to taking issue with others, keeping mum about their human rights abuses, are talking about someone's \"human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great irony is that Japan, a political dwarf not entitled to talk about human rights, took the lead in railroading the anti-DPRK \"resolution\" through the recent session, behaving as if it were a \"human rights judge.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that elementary rights of the popular masses are being ruthlessly violated and terrorist acts against Koreans in Japan, overseas citizens of the sovereign state, and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), their legitimate organization, are being reported in an unbroken chain in Japan, to say nothing of abduction, conspiratorial plots and flesh traffic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It was ridiculous of Japan to have worked hard to hide all these crimes. It was so imprudent to insist that \"the tenure of office of the special rapporteur be extended one year to observe and improve the human rights situation in north Korea\" and cry out for international cooperation in the \"abduction issue\" which had already found a solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan wishes to be entitled to discuss human rights, it should, first of all, make an apology and reparation for such hideous human rights abuses as abducting and taking away at least 8.4 million Koreans, killing more than one million Koreans and forcing at least 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery in the last century. And it should honor its historical and moral commitments to protect the legitimate rights of Koreans in Japan, direct victims of its past colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we would like to warn the EU against its involvement in the racket kicked up by the U.S. and Japan over the \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An overwhelming majority of countries said no to the \"resolution\" because they were of the view that the \"resolution\" was contrary to the universally accepted deliberation function of the council to handle the human rights situation in all countries on an equal footing and wrong as it is aimed at building a structure of confrontation in the council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights precisely represent sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights are firmly guaranteed legally and institutionally in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The present reality goes to prove that there can be no human rights without national sovereignty and one should have strong deterrent if one is to defend genuine human rights and national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The anti-DPRK hostile forces had better stop their rash acts, pondering over the unpredictable consequences to be entailed by their plots and moves to stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is under the signboard of \"combating terrorism\" that the imperialists are perpetrating undisguised aggression to seize major areas rich in resources and strategic strongholds.  More countries may fall victim to the above-said war like Iraq unless people intensify their struggle against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no threat of using tremendous force can the imperialists overpower the might of the united people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the whole course of revolution and construction the DPRK has made positive efforts to forge friendship and solidarity with all countries and peoples of the world, always treasuring solidarity more than anything else in the struggle to make the whole world independent.

But he is busy prodding riff-raffs into the campaign to divert the public criticism of Lee and his group to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this will only embolden fellow countrymen to come out in a nationwide struggle  against the \"war-seeking regime\" and \"regime inciting confrontation\" as it strips bare the anti-reunification, anti-peace and treacherous nature of the group hell-bent on the moves for confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Lee group had better bear this in mind and retract the above-mentioned outbursts little short of a declaration of a war and apologize for them and take measures enough to convince world people, though belatedly. Should they rush headlong into confrontation with the north, denying the above-said outbursts and working hard to lay the blame for the grave situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula at other's door, they will be held accountable for all the ensuing consequences and meet a stern judgment of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the situation will be settled or will deteriorate will entirely depend on the attitude of the south Korean authorities, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Minju Joson Assails Japan's Evermore Undisguised Moves for Overseas Expansion\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Recently Japanese cabinet members, including Prime Minister Fukuda and Chairman of the Diplomacy Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party Yamasaki, agreed to submit to the Diet a \"permanent law\" providing for the overseas dispatch of the \"Self-Defence Forces (SDF)\". The chief executive of Japan blustered at a press conference that they would pass the new \"law\" through the Diet at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves of the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters were evidently prompted by their ulterior motive to promptly hurl SDF troops into any part of the world any time in a bid to lay a springboard for overseas aggression and mount preemptive attacks on other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable intention of the Japanese reactionaries to turn the SDF into regular armed forces and allow them to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence\" and thus legalize the overseas military actions of their aggression forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The operational theatre of the SDF has already been expanded to vast areas in Asia, the Pacific and Indian Ocean, going far beyond Japan's boundary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan resumed its MSDF ships' mission of refueling warships of the U.S. and its allies in the Indian Ocean under the pretext of cooperation in the \"war on terrorism.\" This means operational activities of the militarist forces in the above-said war for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A campaign is making brisk headway to equip the SDF with modern, mobile and long-distance war means and arms buildup is being frantically accelerated to increase its capability for carrying out military operations overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Asia is now fraught with the danger of a new arms race and war due to the military hysteria kicked up by the Japanese reactionaries to launch reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such war hysteria is little short of a criminal act of gravely threatening and disturbing peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. This is, however, as foolish an act as inviting self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
