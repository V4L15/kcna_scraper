It is attributable to the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il that the Korean revolutionary is making a long drive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration, a milestone on the way to Korea's reunification, is also a fruition of the great patriotic idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Communist Party and the people of Syria are convinced that Korea's reunification will surely be achieved according to the idea of \"By our nation itself\" specified in the joint declaration and stand foursquare behind it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a precious fruition of his extraordinary wisdom and distinguished ideological and theoretical activities that the Songun idea of Juche is successfully serving as the guideline of the Korean revolution and publicly recognized ideological current of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This sagacity also finds expression in the fact that he has stoutly trained the army and people of the country into those strong in idea and faith and decisively turned the ideological work into a work of the whole party, state and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the work of modeling the whole society on one idea, the socialist idea, is progressing at a higher stage under the banner of Songun. The main characteristics of the ideological work of the Songun era lie in building up the People's Army into an army strong in idea and faith and, with it as the model, training the revolutionary ranks into elites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his wise leadership, the principle of firmly ensuring the party's leadership over the ideological work has been consistently maintained and media and literature and art have become a powerful ideological weapon in educating and mobilizing the masses in the DPRK. And the state is well playing the function of an ideological and cultural educator, all the working people's organizations and educational institutions regard ideological education as the most important work, and officials in all domains and at all units engage themselves in ideological and political work.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
