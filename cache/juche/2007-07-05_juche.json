            "content": "Japan's Participation in Six-Party Talks Would Create Only Instability in Their Work : KCNA \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- Japan is now becoming so impertinent as to be unusually fretful over the issue of the DPRK's implementation of the February 13 agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by a string of outbursts let loose by high-ranking politicians including Prime Minister Abe. They blustered that \"north Korea should conduct prompt specific actions to implement the steps to be taken at the preliminary phase,\" \"in case it does not honor the agreement, the international community should take strict measures\", \"Japan would closely follow deeds, not words, as regards the implementation of the Feb. 13 agreement\" and \"it would strongly push for progress in the efforts to settle the 'abduction issue'\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear indication that Japan is swimming against the trend of the times, not knowing where it stands. This imprudent behavior of Japan is only inviting the derision of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, Japan is not in a position to say anything to others over such sensitive issues as the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's self-righteous and narrow-minded approach towards issues related to its foreign policy has caused a lot of troubles to the countries concerned. It is also despised by the international community for disturbing the work at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has done nothing but insisting on its far-fetched assertions to incur the displeasure of the countries concerned and lay hurdles in the way of any work presumed to be successful. In the past, too, Japan was so preposterous as to raise the \"abduction issue\", putting a brake on the implementation of the September 19 joint statement and the Feb. 13 agreement and deliberately creating difficulties in the way of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There took place the talks between the working delegations for the normalization of DPRK-Japan relations according to the Feb. 13 agreement but the irresponsible and unreasonable attitude of Japan brought them to a rupture from the very outset. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's behavior is vitiating the atmosphere of dialogue at a time when the issue of holding talks among heads of the delegations to the six-party talks and a meeting of the foreign ministers of the participating countries is high on agenda. Such behavior of Japan can not be construed otherwise than part of the premeditated obstructions on the part of Japan, which is not pleased to see the success of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing conservative forces of Japan are using the six-party talks as leverage to win their political clout in the run-up to the election to the House of Councilors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has refused to fulfil its commitment called for by the Feb. 13 agreement as it does not wish to see any progress at the talks. Japan's participation in the six-party talks is, therefore, cannot but be a factor of creating instability in their work in every sense.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Lurking behind this is their intention to tarnish the image of the DPRK on the international scene and realize their hideous scheme which they pursue through their hostile policy toward it. Their another aim is to invent a pretext to turn Japan into a military power and lay military foundations for militarist overseas expansion by slinging mud at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan is now showing the sign of inveigling even civilian companies into the MD development. Now Japan is getting fidgety over this issue. It is not because Japan is exposed to an immediate threat of someone's ballistic missile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Japan is now seeking is something bigger. It wants to overwhelm its rivals and grab the position of the \"leader\" and dominator of Asia at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Malicious is the intention of the Japanese reactionaries who, while harboring such sinister design, are turning their full vocabulary on the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was an epoch-making measure to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President clarified the three principles of national reunification, the cornerstone for the solution of the reunification issue, conversing with the representatives of the south side on a visit to Pyongyang, and had put his heart and soul in the efforts for its realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the first step to materialize the three principles of national reunification, he proposed for the north and the south to make public the joint statement with the principles as its main content, and elaborated the system and articles of the statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n True to the intention of the President, Kim Jong Il energetically led the efforts to make the joint statement thoroughly embody the three principles and become the reunification programme common to the nation for achieving the independent reunification in accordance with the will and demand of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the north and the south issued the historic joint statement on July 4, Juche 61 (1972). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint statement enabled the entire Korean people to push ahead with the reunification movement more vigorously with a common milestone to take hands with each other on the road of national reconciliation, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The internal forces of reunification have strengthened and prevailed over the separatist forces over the last years though the foreign forces have intensified the anti-reunification challenge. It is entirely thanks to the efforts of Kim Jong Il who has invariably implemented the three principles as the weapon for sure victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean people are recording a new chapter of history in which they are striving to achieve the reconciliation and reunification by our nation itself under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe joint declaration, the milestone for national reunification in the new century, is the banner of the independent reunification era.

Si esto es verdad, debera parar sobre todo sus acciones militares que amenazan a la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Pero, la conducta de EE.UU. muestra que sigue invariable su intencion de atacar a la RPDC con las fuerzas armadas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tal proceder del imperio evidencia que el persigue la guerra en vez de negociaciones y que aboga por el \"dialogo\" para ganar el tiempo necesario a la perfeccion de sus preparativos belicos, lejos de solucionar el problema.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Por eso, esgrime el pretexto de \"hacer frente a la amenaza de misil nuclear del Norte de Corea\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual de este miercoles y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los reaccionarios japoneses arman bulla al calificar de las medidas de amenaza militar a si mismos las de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea tomadas para defenderse. Lo hacen para realizar su malsano proposito que persiguen mediante la politica de hostilidad a la RPDC denigrando la imagen de esta en el plano internacional, por una parte y por la otra, preparar un pretexto para llevar a cabo la potencia militar y asentar la base militar necesaria para la expansion militarista a ultramar acusando a la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En estos momentos Japon muestra la intencion de incorporar a las companias civiles al desarrollo del sistema antimisiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto demuestra que Japon se apresura en el establecimiento de tal sistema no por la inminente amenaza de misil balistico de alguien. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El pais isleno persigue otro objetivo mas grande de aventajarse a sus rivales y ocupar la posicion dominante de \"amo\" de Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Son viles los reaccionarios japoneses que con tal malsano proposito acusan a la RPDC.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
