            "content": "Dangerous Moves to Revise Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines under Fire  \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Japan and the United States are contemplating to revise the \"Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines\" adopted in 1997. It is said that the guidelines to be revised contain the issue of expanding tie-ups between the two countries in overseas military operations under the signboard of \"peace-keeping\", the development of the MD system and the collection and exchange of information materials.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed article terms the new guidelines a U.S.-Japan joint aggressive military action program which is drawn up to launch a worldwide \"war on terrorism\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries framed up the guidelines in 1978 and used them as a tool for aggression against the former Soviet Union. But after the end of the Cold War the guidelines cannot go down with the latter. While talking about the DPRK's non-existent \"missile threat\" and \"suspected underground nuclear facilities\" in 1999, they adopted laws concerning guidelines under the pretext of countering them. With this they have regained the right of belligerency they gave up in terms of the constitution and laid a legal ground for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their attempt to revise the guidelines is pursuant to the intensified moves of the U.S. and Japan for military integration in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the U.S. and Japan have further completed the framework for aggressive alliance. And they have pushed forward the joint development of the MD system. They have escalated joint military exercises and stepped up the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan. This has turned the combination of the commands of the three services of the U.S. and Japan and the integration of their commanding system into reality. The U.S. and the Japanese reactionaries are now seeking to revise the guidelines to suit it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the U.S. major objectives in the revision of the guidelines is to use the Japanese armed forces in carrying out its \"anti-terrorist war\" strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the Japanese reactionaries are keen to finally examine and complete their preparations for reinvasion of Korea with the revision of the guidelines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present guidelines are the Japan-U.S. common scenario for a new war of aggression on Korea and relevant laws are to legalize the scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressors against the DPRK will certainly face death and ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Terms U.S. World's Biggest Illegal Dealer  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The international community is becoming increasingly critical of the U.S. for being a kingpin of illegal transaction.\r\n Internet homepage Conspiracy Planet on April 26 disclosed that American banks have laundered illicit money to the tune of 500 billion U.S. dollars every year. But for such illicit money laundering the U.S. economy would have long gone bankrupt, it observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The April 14 issue of the Austrian newspaper Die Presse quoting a paper presented in the Netherlands reported that the U.S. tops the world's list of dirty money laundering and almost half of it circulated worldwide originated from the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said criticism is by no means fortuitous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Illicit money laundering and other illegal transactions represent deeply rooted bad habits and an incurable disease in the capitalist American society where the struggle for survival based on jungle law is justified and all sorts of crimes are rampant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe criminal organizations in the U.S. are raking in a ridiculous amount of illicit money through a variety of leverage such as fraud and swindle, robbery, prostitution, drug and weapon dealing, smuggling of vehicles, flesh traffic and deal in false securities. They are reinvesting this money in the U.S. economy and buying up many gay quarters and companies in the fields of textile, building, transport and foodstuff, etc., amassing their fortune.  Those organizations leave no means untried to achieve their aims. They bribe financial bodies and officials of the administration and perpetrate violence against their rivals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to information available, the organization known as OK Group earns tens of billions of U.S. dollars annually through such crimes or 1.1 per cent of the gross output value in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what stupendous amount the illicit fund has reached and what is keeping U.S. economy afloat, given the fact that a number of criminal organizations in the U.S. are accumulating their wealth by such methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, any big bank in the U.S. can hardly operate even a single day without such illegal financial sources and this enables criminal organizations to lord it over everything inside the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that the U.S. administration and the political circle are deeply involved in illegal transaction and dirty money laundering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, one of the leaders of the Republican Party Tom was forced to quit the political arena due to various scandals in April. A close associate of Bush, this guy was reported to have been involved in the illicit money laundering while having close relations with monopoly plutocrats. He was said to have embezzled money through illegal dealing on account of fund raising for the election campaign of the party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was disclosed that the Enron which had spent a lot of money for Bush's election campaign accumulated a ridiculous amount of money through illicit money laundering, sparking off a big political furor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hideous scams that break out in the U.S. more often than not are an inevitable result of the reactionary American-style financial oligarchy as the state power and economic lifeline are in the clutches of the monopoly capitalists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ruling quarters are offsetting financial deficits amounting to hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars resulting from the reckless operation of war economy through the circulation of such dirty money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that illegal dealing is vitally required by the U.S. economy kept afloat through aggression and plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts clearly indicate that the U.S. is the world's biggest criminal state that deserves a stern punishment by humankind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
