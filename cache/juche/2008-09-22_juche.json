The KPA is the revolutionary armed forces standing guard over the anti-imperialist military front, the main front of our revolution. Our country is now in direct confrontation with U.S. imperialism. Under this actual condition, it will be impossible to defend the destiny of the country and the nation and socialism without reliance on the KPA. As the KPA safeguards the defence lines of the country impregnably with arms, the security of the country and the nation is guaranteed and Korean socialism is making long strides following up the victory century after century. Neither any class nor any group of society can play the role of the KPA standing guard over the first defence line of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has creditably discharged its role as the main force and shock force not only in the defence of the country but also in socialist construction, true to the Songun revolutionary leadership of the WPK. There is no other group in society that is stronger than the KPA in the revolutionary spirit, sense of organization and the fighting capacity. So, the WPK put forward the KPA as the main force of the revolution with unshakable trust in the KPA, which is the standard-bearer of the revolution devotedly defending the security of the party and the country, socialism and the people and which is the strongest in the spirit of collectivism, the revolutionary spirit, the sense of organization and the fighting capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has grown into the invincible revolutionary armed forces strong in ideology and faith under the leadership of the great leader and the great party. As this army was put forward as the main force of the revolution, our politico-ideological might has been considerably enhanced in the era of Songun and epoch-making miracles ceaselessly wrought in the defence of socialism and the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
