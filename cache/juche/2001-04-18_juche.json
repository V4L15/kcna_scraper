The DPRK does not wish to kill the time going into it pros and cons, the commentary notes.\r\n Calling attention to the fact that the U.S., groundlessly taking issue with the DPRK over \"the cutdown of the conventional weapons,\" is attempting to include the \"cutdown\" in outstanding issues between the DPRK and the U.S., the paper describes the attempt as intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper clarifies the DPRK's stand in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the disarmament, it is not what the U.S. is entitled to call for, but the matter the DPRK should raise to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has never sincerely accepted any proposal of the DPRK for disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the U.S. insistence on \"the cutdown of conventional weapons of the DPRK\" is a very sinister and dangerous intention to justify the U.S. military presence in South Korea and arms buildup, and to disarm and suffocate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troop pullout from South Korea is a prerequisite to disarmament and removal of military confrontation and danger of war from the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be aware of this and pull its troops out of South Korea at the earliest date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it does not do what it should do, persisting in its anti-DPRK diatribe and high-handed practices, it will have to pay dearly for that.    \r\n\r\n"
