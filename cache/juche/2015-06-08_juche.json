            "content": "Christians in Korea Demand Nullification of Revised \"U.S.-Japan Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Christian Federation of Korea and the National Council of Christian Churches in south Korea issued a joint statement on Monday denouncing the U.S. and Japan for threatening peace on the Korean peninsula, in East Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Abe held talks at the White House on April 29 at which they agreed to revise the \"U.S.-Japan Defence Cooperation Guidelines\", which consider the whole world including the Korean peninsula as the operation sphere of the Japan's \"Self-Defence Forces\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the talks the U.S. decided to support even the bid of Japan, war criminal state, for permanent membership of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement dismissed the decision as an insult to the Korean people who had suffered under the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. allows Japan to land on the peninsula in contingency, pursuant to the guidelines, the peaceful reunification of the peninsula will be more difficult and extreme uneasiness will prevail in the north and the south, the statement noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The closer U.S.-Japan cooperation in defence would scrap Japan's policy of exclusive defence and, consequently, spark off hot arms race in East Asia including the peninsula and result in escalating military tension in the region and the rest of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement clarified the following stands:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First. The agreement on revising the \"U.S.-Japan Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" should be nullified at once as it threatens the peace on the Korean peninsula, Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second. The U.S. government should abandon its ambition for military supremacy and make a switchover to peace-loving diplomacy for dialogue and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third. The Japanese government should apologize to the world for its war crimes, abide by the Pacifist Constitution and stop pursuing its ambition to emerge a military giant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fourth. The Christians in the north and the south will pray and take action in solidarity with world churches and conscience of the whole world aspiring after peace so as to preserve peace on the peninsula, in East Asia and the rest of the world."

Korean Authorities' Moves against DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- Paek Kyong Hyon, chairperson of the Zhongnan Regional Association of the General Association of Koreans in China, released an article on June 5 denouncing the south Korean authorities for denying the June 15 joint declaration, depending on foreign forces and resorting to the moves for escalating confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The door of north-south dialogue remains closed, brisk undertakings for cooperation were brought to naught and the danger of military conflict is increasing, the article said, adding it is attributable to the pro-U.S. conservative regime in south Korea which is totally denying the joint declaration and persistently pursuing only the policy for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Park Geun Hye group persistently denies the joint declaration while pursuing the policy for confrontation with the DPRK as henchmen of the U.S., the group will be bitterly cursed and condemned by all Koreans and meet a miserable end, the article warned."
