The unified federal state will neither infringe upon the interests of the neighboring countries nor pose any threat to those countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south of Korea recognized in the historic June 15 joint declaration that there is a community in the north-proposed low-level federation and the south side's proposal for confederation and solemnly declared at home and abroad that they would work for reunification in this direction. Traitor Lee Myung Bak of south Korea is, however, seeking the \"unification of systems,\" not the peaceful reunification of the north and the south, denying the June 15 joint declaration supported and hailed by all Koreans. This is intolerable as it is a criminal act of inciting confrontation between the north and the south and bringing a war of aggression against the north, brushing aside the proposal for achieving reunification by federal formula, a realistic way of achieving national independence and reunification."
