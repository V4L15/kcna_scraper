            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena al \"GPN\" del Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 8 de octubre (ATCC) -- Hace poco, los compinches del \"Gran Partido Nacional (GPN)\" del Sur de Corea, al utilizar los datos del \"Ministerio de Reunificacion\", dijeron que \"es alta la posibilidad\" de ser utilizado como \"fondo para el desarrollo de las armas nucleares\" el dinero enviado durante 10 anos pasados al Norte. Tambien, a base de los datos  absurdos de que recientemente la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea introdujo las armas de otros paises, insistieron en que \"esta logro el aumento del poderio militar\" mientras que el Sur de Corea \"estaba en debate sobre la imprudente asistencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t No puede ser perdonable jamas esta peroracion tendente a insultar las labores de cooperacion Norte-Sur desarrolladas favorablemente a lo largo de estos 10 anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse disparate muestra el intento criminal del \"GPN\" para racionalizar sus actos traidores que detuvieron el avance de la epoca de reunificacion iniciada el 15 de Junio y llevaron al fracaso las relaciones Norte-Sur e inculcar la nueva confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de  este miercoles y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa fuerza disuasiva nuclear de la RPDC que sirve del poderoso medio para la paz de la Peninsula Coreana es el resultado de la linea de la construccion de la economia nacional independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos compinches del \"GPN\" no pueden conocerlo jamas. Por esta razon, ellos profieren tales maldiciones absurdas como la \"posibilidad del fondo para el desarrollo de las armas nucleares del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cooperacion Norte-Sur no es el trabajo que una parte ofrece los intereses a la otra, sino una labor patriotica para el desarrollo y la prosperidad comunes de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, el \"GPN\" que trata de abusarlo para su vil objeto politico hablando de cual o tal del respecto es justamente una entidad politica antinacional y anti-reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ellos, al hablar de los \"diez anos perdidos\", persiguen el siniestro objetivo de negar todas las declaraciones conjuntas Norte-Sur que apoyan y aplauden todos los coreanos y volver la epoca de reunificacion iniciada el 15 de Junio a la de enfrentamiento del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActuan arbitrariamente sin contar las consecuencias de su modo de pensar y su accion  capaces de agravar el enfrentamiento con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui precisamente la ignorancia y la tragedia de ellos."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia maniobras belicas de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 8 de octubre (ATCC) -- El pasado 23 de septiembre la camara de representantes del Congreso norteamericano aprobo el \"proyecto de ley para el fortalecimiento de la cooperacion de defensa\" norteamericano-surcoreana cuya esencia es elevar la posicion del Sur de Corea en la compra de armas y pertrechos militares norteamericanos al nivel de la OTAN y luego, el senado dio luz verde al \"proyecto de ley\" de igual contenido.\n\t\t\t\t\t La aprobacion de este proyecto de ley es revelacion de la intencion de dar toque final a los preparativos de la segunda guerra coreana y estrechar las \"relaciones de alianza militar\" norteamericano-surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 8 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se trata de un acto criminal que exacerba el estado de tension y la confrontacion militar de la Peninsula Coreana y amenaza gravemente la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. intenta tomar a los titeres surcoreanos como fiel \"aliado militar\" y ejecutor de agresion en el cumplimiento de su estrategia coreana para utilizarlos oportunamente en la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. atribuye significado importante al establecimiento del control monopolista a la region de Asia en la realizacion de la estrategia al dominio del mundo. Para este fin, intenta tomar la absoluta supremacia estrategica militar en esta region, trata de crear un nuevo \"aparato de seguridad\" a estilo de la OTAN en la region asiatica y tomarlo por palanca  para aventajarse a Corea y controlar militarmente a Asia. Esto es la intencion estrategica de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ahora es precisamente un tiempo en que la RPDC y EE.UU. deben promover el ambiente de confianza y alivio. Pero, EE.UU. toma las medidas legales para el \"fortalecimiento de la cooperacion de defensa\" con el Sur de Corea con miras a aplastar a Corea y de esta manera exacerba el estado de tension militar e incrementa el peligro de la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana. Esto es un acto anti-pacifico que contraviene a la corriente de la epoca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. debe reflexionar de las consecuencias que emanen de su proceder y abandonar la temeraria intencion militar."
