In less than one month since its appearance the Bush administration carried out air raids on Iraq, thus demonstrating its \"strength\" as the kingpin of terrorism. Recently it again bombed Iraqi civilian facilities and residential quarters, killing or wounding many people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the case, the U.S. cited the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" out of its guilty conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has clarified more than once its principle and stand on opposing all forms of terrorism and has put them into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is labelling other countries as \"terrorism sponsors\" and putting political and military pressure on them. This is aimed to conceal its true colours as the kingpin of international terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Washington had better mind its own business. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to have its terrorists' hands stained with blood washed before taking issue with others. \r\n\r\n"

This will give impetus to the growing movement of the Korean nation for reunification and the improvement of the north-south relations and contribute to ensuring peace and stability on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson stresses that there is no change in the DPRK's stand to favourably develop the relations with the EU. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on three principles of national reunification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article says that the three principles of national reunification serve as a cornerstone of national reunification as they provide the Korean nation with fundamental principles, basic ways and guarantees for solving the issue of reunification by the nation's efforts in conformity with its independent requirements and basic interests.\r\n The article further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence is a fundamental principle of reunification reflecting its nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essentially required to reunify the country independently is for the Korean nation to be responsible for the issue and hold fast to the stand of solving the issue independently on the principle of national self-determination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All members of the nation should join efforts to reunify the country independently with high national pride and dignity. Herein lies the most right way of overcoming all obstacles and achieving national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of peaceful reunification indicates the basic way of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Korea is to be reunified peacefully it is necessary to defuse the tensions and remove the danger of war and the U.S. should drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK to stifle it and opt for ensuring a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of great national unity provides the north and south of Korea with differing ideologies and systems with a fundamental guarantee for solving the issue of national reunification by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic purpose of the great national unity is to provide a sure guarantee for the independent and peaceful reunification by pushing aside the differing ideologies and systems in the north and south, placing the common interests of the nation above all and achieving the great national unity of all Koreans desirous of national reunification on that basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, south and abroad should promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and join efforts to reunify the country regardless of differing ideologies and systems.    \r\n\r\n"
