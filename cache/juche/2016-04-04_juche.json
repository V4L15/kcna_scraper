On the contrary, nuclear weapons are posing a greater threat to global peace and security. It is by no means fortuitous that the international community is claiming Obama is chiefly to blame for this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by this, the Obama group is trying hard to evade the accusations by taking issue with the DPRK, a trite method.  But this is a foolish act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The atrocities the U.S. perpetrated by dropping A-bombs on mankind are the thrice-cursed monstrous crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the world's nuclear criminal who has worked hard to maintain its hegemonic position by recklessly wielding a nuclear stick, regarding nuclear threat and blackmail as the tenet of its foreign policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an undeniable historical fact hard to hide and a stark reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known that the Bush administration had posed a nuclear threat to the DPRK since it designated the anti-U.S. independent states including the DPRK as \"axis of evil\" and targets of preemptive nuclear attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration has squandered a fabulous amount of funds for modernizing nuclear weapons, far from doing anything for denuclearization quite contrary to its advocacy of building \"a world without nuclear weapons.\" After adopting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK as its policy, it is staging madcap drills under the simulated conditions of a nuclear war by introducing all type strategic nuclear strike means into the Korean peninsula\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the Obama administration took office, the U.S. strategic nuclear strike means introduced into south Korea have increased several times, far from decreasing in their scope and number, and its nuclear war drills have become more provocative in their nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, at the same time, escalating the hostile moves against the DPRK to the maximum, openly revealing its intention to screw up the political and economic pressure on the DPRK by setting in motion its followers and allies for the implementation of the UN \"resolution on sanctions\" cooked up against the DPRK's inevitable choice for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the truth about the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the cause of escalating tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Confrontation and danger of a war are escalating in Northeast Asia as the U.S. is seeking to tighten the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military cooperation and, furthermore, form a new military bloc for aggression under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation more urgently requires than ever before the DPRK to bolster the nuclear deterrent for self-defence as it serves as a treasured sword to ensure the sovereignty and prosperity of the country and protect the global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's bolstering up of its nuclear deterrent in every way is an inevitable choice and a legitimate exercise of the right to self-defence to cope up with the U.S. extreme nuclear threat and blackmail and nuclear war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already clarified, the DPRK will take decisive toughest countermeasures against the U.S. ever-escalating nuclear war threat and pressure in the future, too."

This was profound confusing of the right and wrong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obama claimed that the international community is exposed to threat due to ceaseless provocations of the north such as nuclear tests and missile launches and that international cooperation would be boosted with allies and partners to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Echoing his master's utterances, Abe blustered that the north's improvement of nuclear and missile capability poses a direct threat to the international community and it is necessary to slap harsher sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not to lag behind her masters Park Geun Hye reeled off a flurry of sophism that south Korea joined the U.S. in its efforts to build a world without nuclear weapons but the north is blatantly challenging the efforts of the international community. She went the lengths of jabbering that the building of a world without nuclear weapons should start from the Korean peninsula, adding that it is necessary to make the north realize that it can not live unless it dismantles nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the ridiculous behavior of the fool who feign ignorance of how nuclear issue was spawned on the peninsula though they are well aware of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue on the peninsula was spawned by the U.S. from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear threat has further increased for several decades since the group of aggressors floated the story of \"dropping A bombs\" on the northern half of Korea in the last Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every year the U.S. has undisguisedly staged nuclear war drills against the DPRK with various type nuclear weapons involved since the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK was adopted as a state policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment, more than 300,000 huge forces of the U.S. and south Korean puppet army and U.S. nuclear strategic weaponry including B-52 nuclear strategic bombers, nuclear submarines and nuclear carrier task force are busy with nuclear war rehearsals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that this is a serious infringement upon the security and peace of the DPRK and a direct threat to the lives of the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail and joint military exercises are the root cause of the danger of a nuclear conflict on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was quite just and inevitable for the DPRK to have had access to nuclear weapons and taken measures to bolster up them now that the U.S. and its followers have become keen to threaten the DPRK with nuclear weapons and encroach upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has stockpiled the world's largest number of nuclear weapons and committed a hideous nuclear crime by using nuclear weapons for the first time in the world.

This is nonsensical and the height of deception of justice and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that the international community today comments that the way of settling the issue of the Korean peninsula is to acknowledge the DPRK as a nuclear power and opt for improving the DPRK-U.S. relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defying this fact, nuclear criminals led by the U.S. is talking about the DPRK's dismantlement of nuclear weapons and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This is Don Quixote way of thinking and a pipe dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already clarified that there can never be denuclearization of the Korean peninsula without that of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is unimaginable unless nuclear powers including the U.S. completely defuse worldwide nuclear threat through nuclear disarmament negotiations and the White House opts for improving the DPRK-U.S. relations,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Threat from the north\" and \"international cooperation for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\" which the U.S., chieftain of nuclear war, and its servants have touted so much are, in fact, no more than a desperate shriek of those taken aback by the tremendous nuclear deterrence of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more loudly the U.S. and its followers vociferate about \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK while shelving their own nuclear issue, the more saliently they will reveal their attempt for nuclear monopoly to dominate the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK categorically rejects the groundless story about denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and will decisively counter the hostile forces with nuclear deterrence for self-defence, should they seek to encroach upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit."

mando de Estados Unidos. \n\t\t\t\t\tEn conclusion, fue un lugar de complots de EE.UU., otros paises criminales nucleares y sus seguidores para imputar a la RPDC la responsabilidad de la amenaza nuclear que se aumenta en escala mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos gobernantes de EE.UU., Japon y el Sur de Corea tergiversan la realidad como si el empeoramiento de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del mundo se debiera a la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObama dijo que la sociedad internacional \"se ve amenazada por las provocaciones consecutivas del Norte de Corea como la prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de misil\" y que \"intensificara la colaboracion internacional con los paises aliados y los acompanantes para la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, Abe disparateo que \"el mejoramiento de la capacidad nuclear y de misil del Norte de Corea deviene una amenaza directa a la sociedad internacional\" y que \"es preciso tomar las medidas de sancion mas rigurosas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tanto, Park Geun-hye tambien solto los disparates semejantes tales como \"nos hemos esforzado juntos por construir un mundo sin armas nucleares, pero el Norte de Corea desafia frontalmente a los esfuerzos de la sociedad internacional\", \"el mundo libre de armas nucleares debe ser iniciado desde la Peninsula Coreana\" y \"hare al Norte de Corea entender que no puede subsistir sin renunciar las armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo esto no pasa de ser una absurdidad de quienes a sabiendas del curso del surgimiento del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana, se fingen ignorantes de ello. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema controvertido fue ocasionado indudablemente por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. va aumentandose durante varios decenios desde cuando los agresores yanquis insistieron en el \"lanzamiento de bomba atomica\" sobre la region de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe establecio oficialmente como politica estatal de EE.UU. el ataque preventivo nuclear anti-RPDC y se introducen cada ano en la Peninsula Coreana los pertrechos de guerra nuclear de diferentes tipos del imperio desarrollando abiertamente los ejercicios de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este momento tambien se entregan a los simulacros de guerra nuclear mas de 300 mil efectivos norteamericanos y surcoreanos y enormes medios estrategicos nucleares de EE.UU. como los cazabombarderos nucleares, submarinos nucleares y el colectivo de golpe de portaaviones nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo cabe duda de que esto viole gravemente la seguridad y la paz de la RPDC y amenaza directamente el derecho a la existencia del pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa amenaza y chantaje nucleares y los ejercicios belicos conjuntos de EE.UU. resultan la causa raigal que llevo la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana a la coyuntura tirante en que pueda estallar una guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que EE.UU. y sus satelites amenazan con armas nucleares a la RPDC y se desesperan por denigrar su dignidad y soberania, es muy justo e inevitable que ella haya poseido y las armas nucleares y consolidado su disuasivo nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una ilogica y climax de engano a la justicia y la paz que EE.UU., el Sur de Corea y Japon hablen de la \"amenaza\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el mayor poseedor de armas nucleares y unico pais que las uso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos han convertido el suelo surcoreano en la base avanzada nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon poseyo de manera explicita e implicita enorme cantidad de plutonio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, la sociedad internacional estima que el remedio para la solucion del problema de la Peninsula Coreana es que EE.UU. reconozca a la RPDC como potencia nuclear y mejore las relaciones con ella. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespreciando esta opinion, los criminales nucleares acaudillados por EE.UU. hablan de la renuncia nuclear y la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana, lo cual es el modo de pensamiento ilogico al estilo de Don Quijote y la ilusion nunca realizable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos aclarado que la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana es imposible al margen de la desnuclearizacion del mundo entero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que EE.UU. y otras potencias nucleares no eliminen completamente la amenaza nuclear en la esfera mundial mediante las negociaciones de desarme nuclear y la Casa Blanca no mejore las relaciones con la RPDC, es inimaginable la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"amenaza del Norte\" y la \"colaboracion internacional por la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana\", de que hablaron en homofonia el caudillo de la guerra nuclear EE.UU. y sus sirvientes, no pasan de ser un alarido agonico de los aturdidos ante el fuerte disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas EE.UU. hable ruidosamente de la \"amenaza nuclear\" de alguien sin hacer caso del problema nuclear de si mismo, tanto mas se revelaran su invariable ambicion de hegemonia mundial y el intento de monopolizacion nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC frustrara rotundamente la absurda insistencia en la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y respondera con el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa a las fuerzas hostiles que denigren aun en lo minimo la soberania y dignidad nacionales."
