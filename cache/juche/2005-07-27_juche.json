Security Council at the recent plenary meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. Japan was the first country to introduce it there.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary carried in this regard says that such impertinent behavior shunning its commitments will only invite disgrace, adding a political dwarf always deserves this cold shoulder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., viewing Japan as a potential rival in executing its world strategy, is keen to keep it in its clutches, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, resentful at the U.S. for hitting it hard in the past, intends to take revenge upon Washington one day. It is the U.S. notion that Japan can do it on a long-term basis if it sits on the UNSC. Various international organizations, NGOs, countries in Asia that suffered huge damage due to Japan in the past and broad strata of world people have heaped curses on it, infuriated and disillusioned with its behavior negating its history of aggression and evading the redemption of its past crimes. Finding it hard to swim against such trend of the world, the U.S. might dismiss the \"resolution\" which Japan took so much pain to present to the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is pitiful and ridiculous of Japan to dream of sitting on the UNSC without knowing how other countries view it. Japan would be well advised to think about a political dwarf-style inferior diplomacy and its sorry sight.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Three Principles of National Reunification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- The three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--advanced by President Kim Il Sung are an immortal programme for the solution to the issue of Korea's reunification and a cornerstone of national reunification as they indicate the basic stand and way to settle the issue by the nation itself in keeping with its will and interests, says Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article.\r\n The article further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To reunify the country independently is the intrinsic requirement for hewing out the destiny of the nation and the most fundamental principle for solving the reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Korea's reunification is entirely an internal affair of the Korean nation and it is an issue related to the sovereignty of the nation. Accordingly, the reunification of the country should be certainly achieved by the Koreans, the master responsible for it, themselves in accordance with the independent will and requirement of the nation. This issue can never be settled with dependence on foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification should be achieved in a peaceful way, not by the use of armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cannot be achieved in such way that one of both sides, the north and the south, forces its own will on the other, meeting its own interests only. The national reunification should be achieved in such way as to realize the reconciliation and unity of the whole nation and ensure unified development and prosperity of the country. If the north and the south fight each other, the Korean nation itself will suffer disasters and it will only help foreign forces fish in troubled waters. To reunify the country peacefully, not by armed forces, is the most reasonable way that conforms with the common interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great national unity is a decisive guarantee for achieving the national reunification independently and peacefully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of national reunification is not for settling class contradiction among the nation or confrontation between the systems, but for relinking the blood vessel of the nation severed into the north and the south and achieving national reconciliation and unity to regain the appearance of the homogeneous Korean nation and establish the sovereignty of the nation throughout the whole country. If all the Koreans love the country, concern about the destiny of the nation and desire for national reunification before anything else, it will be possible for the nation to achieve its great unity under any circumstances though there are differences in ideology, ism, religious belief, political view, class and stratum.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
