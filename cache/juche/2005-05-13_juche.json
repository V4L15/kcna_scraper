            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Advantages of Socialist Planned Economy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The socialist economy is a planned economy and self-supporting economy, Rodong Sinmun Thursday says in a signed article. It calls for firmly abiding by the socialist principle in the economic construction, fully convinced of the advantages of the socialist planned economy, and thereby building a great prosperous powerful country of Juche on this land as early as possible.\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The planned economy is a method of managing and operating the economy suited to the nature of socialist society and it is incomparably superior to the capitalist market economy. The advantages of the socialist \r\nplanned economy mean the superiority of collectivism to individualism and the indisputable superiority of the socialist ownership to the private ownership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist planned economy calls for setting targets and orientation of economic construction, pursuant to the line and policy of the party, and thoroughly carrying them out. It is an advantageous economic system as it makes it possible to give fullest play to the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative ingenuity of the popular masses.\r\n The intrinsic nature and advantages of the socialist economy lie in that the economy serves the people and makes steady progress thanks to the inexhaustible creative energy of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The planning system in the country ensures planned and balanced development of the national economy because it calls for establishing the system and order whereby to combine the state centralized guidance with the mass line under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea in drawing up and implementing a plan. Under the above-said system officials of the state planning organ and higher bodies well informed of the needs of the Party and the state and the overall economic life of the country are required to go down to the lower units and work out any plan through exhaustive discussions with the producer masses and make them regard any adopted plan as their own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis process makes it possible to overcome both subjectivism and egoism in planning. This system encourages individual units to properly display their independence so that all the working people can produce more social wealth of better quality for the prosperity of the country and their happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist planned economy is a profitable economic system as it ensures steady rapid progress of social production. \r\nBut the market economy for money making or a dependent economy aimed at bringing profits to foreign monopoly capitalists only are diametrically running counter to the interests of the popular masses. It can never match the planned and independent socialist economy in terms of rate of development, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Robber-like Document to Grab Tok Islet Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government at a ministerial meeting some time ago approved the \"2005 diplomatic blue book\" designating the Tok Islet, an inviolable part of the Korean territory, as one belonging to Japan.\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun in a commentary today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is another proof that the Japanese reactionaries' moves to grab the islet have so far been stepped up with the premeditated and organized support of the government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government claims in the \"diplomatic blue book\" that the islet \"is explicitly Japan's inviolable territory in view of historical facts and international law.\" This is an entirely unjustifiable act intended to make the seizure of Tok Islet its policy and indoctrinate the Japanese people with the idea of Japan's \"dominium\" over it in an effort to rouse public sentiments in its realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That Tok Islet has been an inseparable part of the territory of the Korean nation handed down by its ancestor from one thousand and several hundred years ago is unequivocally stated in many state documents and historical materials of Korea and Japanese historical materials which fully prove this by history and law. This was also made clear in the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, an international legal document published by the allied nations with regard to Japan defeated in World War II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The far-fetched claim of Japan that the islet is \"an inviolable part\" of Japan, which totally negates and distorts this stark fact backed by history and international law, is a wanton encroachment upon Korea's \r\nsovereignty and an agitation of reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"diplomatic blue book\" approved by the Japanese government is a green light for grabbing the islet. \r\nIt suggests that the Japanese government has confirmed the seizure of the islet as its immediate goal. However, Japan's wild ambition for seizing the islet is like a midsummer dream of a dog. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government would be well advised to revoke the robber-like document at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
