            "content": "GNP's Acts of Treachery under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute Thursday made public an indictment to let the public know better about the anti-reunification and treacherous acts perpetrated by the Grand National Party of south Korea (GNP). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the north-south summit is a national event of weighty importance in achieving peace and reunification of the country and settling the issues related to the destiny and future of the nation, the indictment said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic Pyongyang meeting in June, 2000, the first of its kind in the dozens of years-long history of territorial division, turned the inter-Korean relations of distrust and confrontation into those of reconciliation and cooperation and ushered in the era of \"By our nation itself,\" the new era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hearts of all Koreans are now full of great hope and confidence in the north-south summit slated to take place in October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the GNP, utterly indifferent to the destiny of the nation and peace and reunification of the country, has categorically opposed the summit from the very day the report on it was released, getting more frantic with sycophantic and treacherous acts, confrontation with the DPRK and moves to seize power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits particular attention is that the GNP ran the whole gamut of groundless vituperation and sheer sophism to slander the summit. The GNP gentries took issue with every clause of the August 5 agreement on the summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing but far-fetched assertions. Their behavior reminds us of their predecessors who malignantly spoke ill of the April 8 agreement and the historic June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the GNP's decision that it would not send its delegate to the summit, such anti-reunification traitors as the GNP are not entitled to participate in the significant event to discuss important issues of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The disgusting approach of the GNP towards the summit is clearly manifested in its row over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had Ri Myong Bak been chosen as presidential candidate from the GNP than he talked nonsense that the summit should not be held unless the north abandons its nuclear program, having a summit before the north's dismantlement of its nuclear program means the recognition of the north's access to nukes and it would not be helpful to progress at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP gentries' cry out for the \"abandonment of the nuclear program\" not only betrays their treacherous colors as the poor guys who try to prolong their remaining days in reliance upon outside forces but bespeaks themselves that they are no more than the political imbeciles who know nothing about the essence of the nuclear issue and are unable to judge what is core and priority in this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They are opposed to the summit, asserting that it would adversely affect the forthcoming south Korean \"presidential elections.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are malignantly decrying the summit, describing it as a \"backdoor political dealing\" and \"drain on resources for the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the hackneyed practice of the GNP clan to hamstring any effort to warm up the north-south relations, painting it as \"drain on resources\" and \"backdoor dealing.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north-south summit provides the most precious opportunity of dialogue to independently solve the national issue, the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, remove the distrust and confrontation between compatriots and develop the inter-Korean relations in the common interests of the nation, the indictment said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has brought into bolder relief its pro-U.S. sycophantic and treacherous and anti-reunification nature by blatantly challenging the summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most disgusting is that it is not hesitating to shamelessly woo outsiders to bar the summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP gentries, when meeting a legislator from the Republican Party of the U.S. who came to Seoul to participate in the 8th joint meeting of the south Korea-U.S. \"lawmakers' diplomatic consultative council\" on August 28, implored him to render cooperation in their efforts to deter the summit from taking place. They uttered it is unreasonable for the government to go ahead with the arrangements for the summit with the north as just a few months are left before the end of its term of office and it might make the settlement of the nuclear issue difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On August 29, Ri Myong Bak visited the U.S. Ambassador in Seoul Vershbow and begged him to tell the U.S. administration to pressurize the present \"government for people\" to leave the summit to the next \"regime,\" claiming that the summit would not be helpful to the dismantlement of the nuclear program, no agreement should be allowed as it would mean tolerating the nuclear program or recognizing the access to nukes and the summit may effect the presidential elections. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is also conspiring with the Japanese reactionaries in a bid to hold in check the summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It actively supported the U.S. war exercises against the north held in south Korea on the threshold of the important event of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It even pressurized the south Korean authorities to \"give up\" the summit, saying that the summit may worsen the \"alliance\" with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP gentries have instigated the ultra-right conservatives and conservative media to kick up a more frantic racket of confrontation with the DPRK in bid to vitiate the atmosphere of the summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservatives have taken issue even with the schedule of the summit. They are working hard to blindfold the president and stop his mouth and ears. They are so imprudent as to teach him that he should neither appreciate the performance of Arirang nor visit certain places in Pyongyang and that he should not forget to say something while refraining from uttering something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey went the lengths of threatening that if the authorities go ahead with the arrangements for the summit they would encounter \"a violent headwind and resistance,\" while branding the summit as a \"treason.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the GNP is making desperate efforts to hold in check and torpedo the summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that nothing is more stupid and foolish than the behaviors of Ri Myong Bak and the GNP which dare slander and oppose the sacred summit, the indictment declared that all Koreans in the north and the south would never pardon the treacherous acts of the GNP but mete out a stern judgment to it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- Yun Ki Jin, chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification, reportedly posted an article titled \"Chairman of the National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il and Songun politics\" on the Internet homepage on Sept. 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article referred to the fact that the \"2007 south Korean youth and students academic festival on reunification -youth and students' contest in papers\" was slated to take place in Seoul on Sept. 9 on the theme of \"North in the era of Songun and future of the Korean Peninsula\" against the backdrop of the daily growing interest of the compatriots in the south in the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that this contest, the third of its kind to be held in south Korea, is aimed to help the masses properly know about Songun, the article continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is said to be based on the idea of attaching importance to arms, the slogan that \"Weapons are our life and soul! Counter armed force with armed force!\" put up by President Kim Il Sung in the early days of the anti-Japanese armed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il formulated the Songun political mode, regarding the President's idea of attaching importance to arms as its basis and starting point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is known to have formulated the Songun politics as a main political mode under socialism, leading the \"Arduous March\" in the 1990s and the fiercer confrontation between the north and the U.S. to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made sure that the state machinery was reorganized with the National Defence Commission as a centre at the session of the Supreme People's Assembly held on Sept. 5, 1998. He thus provided a guarantee for giving priority to the army in the state machinery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The start of the dynamic drive for building a great prosperous powerful nation was also a product of the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The launch of the satellite \"Kwangmyongsong No. 1\" brought new hope to the forces in the south in their struggle for independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The interest in the Songun politics, an engine propelling the movement for independent reunification, is rapidly growing and there is a mounting movement among many countries of the world to wage an anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle under the banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "IRP acusa los crimenes antinacionales del \"GPN\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 28 de septiembre (ATCC) -- El Instituto de Reunificacion de la Patria (IRP) hizo publico el dia 27 un acta de acusacion para dar a conocer ampliamente los crimenes anti-reunificacion y antinacionales del \"Gran Partido Nacional\" (\"GPN\") del Sur de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El documento senala en particular: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El encuentro cumbre Norte-Sur de Corea es un acto nacional de capital importancia para solucionar el problema de la paz y la reunificacion del pais y decidir el destino y el futuro de la nacion coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El encuentro de ese tipo, realizado en junio de 2000 en Pyongyang por primera vez en la historia de varios decenios de division nacional, convirtio las relaciones de desconfianza y confrontacion de ambas partes en las de reconciliacion y colaboracion y abrio la epoca de \"entre nosotros, los connacionales\", nueva era de reunificacion independiente. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ahora, todos los coreanos cifran gran esperanza y conviccion en el encuentro cumbre Norte-Sur de octubre que se aproxima. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, el \"GPN\", que no toma en consideracion el destino de la nacion ni la paz y la reunificacion del pais, se opuso desde el principio, sin ninguna razon, a ese evento nacional recurriendo mas a los actos serviles a grandes potencias y vendepatrias, la confrontacion con el Norte de Corea y a las maniobras por conquistar el \"Poder\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ante todo, esa entidad politica lo calumnio e insulto con improperios y sofismas absurdisimos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tambien, acusa todos los articulos del acuerdo del 5 de agosto sobre ese encuentro Norte-Sur. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esta conducta es igual a la de sus antecesores quienes maldijeron el acuerdo del 8 de abril y la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur del 15 de Junio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El \"GPN\" anuncio que no enviaria a su representante a ese evento nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Menos mal que el \"GPN\" se ausente porque en esa cita sagrada, donde se discuten importantes asuntos nacionales, no hay puestos para la horda de traidores anti-reunificacion como esta entidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La repugnante postura del \"GPN\" en contra de esa reunion de maximo nivel se corroboro en los escandalos que forma el cuestionando el problema nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tan pronto como se nominara como candidato a la presidencia por el \"GPN\", Ri Myong Bak, dijo que \"No se debe realizar el encuentro cumbre mientras que el Norte no renuncia a sus armas nucleares\", \"Si eso se lleva a cabo sin la cancelacion nuclear por el Norte, significaria el reconocimiento a sus armas nucleares\" y \"Esa reunion no contribuira al avance de las conversaciones a 6 bandas\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Siendo una accion repugnante antinacional de los que se sustentan dependiendo de las fuerzas foraneas, ese \"canto de la cancelacion nuclear\" demuestra de por si que los pandilleros del \"GPN\" son politiqueros imbeciles que no pueden percatarse de la esencia del problema nuclear ni problema que debe ser solucionado primero. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esa banda insiste en que el evento en cuestion es un intento para ejercer influencias sobre las \"elecciones presidenciales\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por otra parte, lo calumnian como \"negocio politico en secreto\" y \"asistencia unilateral al Norte\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es un vicio cronico de los compinches del \"GPN\" soltar esas injurias cada vez que daban un paso adelante las relaciones Norte-Sur. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El encuentro cumbre Norte-Sur deviene la etapa mas sublime del dialogo para solucionar de manera independiente con las propias fuerzas unidas de la nacion coreana los problemas nacionales como el de reunificacion, disipar la desconfianza y la confrontacion entre los coterraneos y desarrollar las relaciones de ambas partes coreanas conforme a los intereses comunes de la nacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, el \"GPN\" desafio frontalmente a este encuentro revelando fehacientemente su naturaleza servil a EE.UU., anti-reunificacion y antinacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sobre todo, no vacila en formular peticiones vergonzosas a las fuerzas foraneas para abortar el encuentro cumbre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los pandilleros del \"GPN\" solicitaron el 28 de agosto a un congresista republicano de EE.UU. quien llego a Seul para participar en la VIII reunion conjunta del \"Consejo consultivo diplomatico de parlamentarios\" Sur de Corea-EE.UU., que impidiera el encuentro cumbre diciendo que \"es un acto irrazonable que el gobierno, al que le quedan unos meses de mandato, promoviera el encuentro cumbre con el Norte\" y \"esto podra dificultar la solucion del problema nuclear\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al reunirse el 29 de agosto con el embajador norteamericano en el Sur de Corea Bershbow, Ri Myong Bak solicito que EE.UU. presionara al \"gobierno de participacion para el pueblo\" para que este dejara el encuentro cumbre para el proximo \"Poder\" arguyendo que \"esta cita no sirve para la eliminacion de armas nucleares y puede influir sobre las elecciones presidenciales\" y que \"no se debe contraer ningun acuerdo admitiendo y reconociendo la posesion nuclear\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El \"GPN\" colabora tambien con los reaccionarios japoneses para alcanzar el mismo objetivo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por otra parte, respaldo activamente los ejercicios belicos de EE.UU. para la agresion al Norte realizados en el Sur de Corea en visperas del importante evento nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para colmo, presiono a las autoridades surcoreanas para que \"desistan\" del encuentro cumbre diciendo que esta reunion puede empeorar las \"relaciones de alianza\" con EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A fin de envenenar el ambiente del encuentro, desarrolla con una gran locura la campana de confrontacion con el Norte instigando a las fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas y los medios de prensa conservadores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al cuestionar la agenda del encuentro y tratar de tapar la vista, la boca y el oido del \"presidente\", las fuerzas ultraderechistas instruyen atrevidamente que cuando la delegacion surcoreana vaya a Pyongyang, no debe ver la funcion gimnastico-artistica masiva \"Arirang\" ni visitar ciertos lugares y hay que decir estas cosas y las otras no. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De mal en peor, amenazan que se producira \"una fuerte ola de rechazo y resistencia\" si se impulsa de continuo el encuentro cumbre y lo califican de \"acto antiestatal\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los hechos arriba mencionados demuestran que el \"GPN\" se esfuerza desesperadamente por frustrar el inminente encuentro cumbre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, tales acciones de Ri y otros pandilleros del  \"GPN\" encaminadas a insultar y frenar el sagrado encuentro cumbre resultan una gran tonteria igual a dar patadas al cielo por gusto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los coreanos del Norte y el Sur no perdonaran jamas esos actos criminales antinacionales del \"GPN\" y otros traidores de igual calana y los castigaran duro.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
