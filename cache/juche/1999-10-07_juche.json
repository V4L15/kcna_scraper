It produces a soft, elegant sound and its operation is rhythmical and beautiful. Its structure is simple and it is easy to learn. The instrument, with the strings set in a block of wood, is used as musical accompaniment or for solo music. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Starting out with 12 strings, it developed into a 13-stringed instrument after Korea's liberation from Japanese rule in August 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is plucked by the fingernails of the right hand to produce a ringing, bell-like sound, with the left fingers pulling the hooked strings to alternate the sound. Its main use is for playing lyric folk music. The 13-stringed instrument has some shortcomings, that is, it is small in scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This instrument has been progressively mechanized to expand the compass. The introduction of a new string-clamping device makes it possible to select the necessary pitch changes on the strings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While retaining its soft, elegant tone, the improved instrument gives great volume. This has been accompanied by a change in its method of sound production: The use of both hands in playing creates a rich, large volume of sound. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kayagum is used for solo music as well as being an ensemble instrument. It plays a major part in folk music. It is also used as an important rhythm-instrument in folk-music orchestras, instrumental concerts and ensemble. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are a small-sized instruments for children and a large sized ones that perform as bass instruments.   Kayagum ensembles and solo ensembles are particularly popular among the people. \r\n\r\n"
