They are, at the same time, becoming evermore outrageous in their moves to suppress Koreans in Japan and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary carried in this regard terms such moves of the Japanese reactionaries an unpardonable criminal act of infringing upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK and a poor charade intended to tide over their present political crisis and prolong their remaining days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are leaving no means untried to drive the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the DPRK-Japan relations to the extreme pitch of tension in a bid to have a chance to achieve their sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their reckless campaign of suppression against Chongryon is part of their moves to achieve the above-said objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They have become desperate in their moves to destroy even Chongryon, not content with cracking down upon Koreans in Japan in defiance of the requirements of international law and ethics and morality. Their moves to seize buildings of Chongryon, in particular, indicate that their moves to bring the Korean community in Japan to a collapse have reached the worst danger line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the political situation in Japan is characterized by mayhem and crisis. Fierce are the confrontation and enmity between the political forces, ruling and opposition parties, all keen to realize their wild ambitions to exercise power by taking the initiative in politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upset by this, the Japanese reactionaries are foolishly seeking to prolong the remaining days of their political careers by leading elsewhere the Japanese people's discontent and criticism of them through the extended sanctions against the DPRK and intensified crackdown upon Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves on the part of the Japanese reactionaries would only leave them more miserably forsaken by the people and put their political destiny at greater peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish of Japan to pin any hope on the sanctions against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

These were unpardonable and most hideous abductions as they brought to light their aggressive, brutal and brigandish nature, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any violator of international law is liable to punishment under this law without exception. No statute of limitations is applicable to the crimes against humanity. Japan can never escape this punishment for those crimes. But the Japanese reactionaries have so far made desperate efforts to evade the responsibility for them and have refused to admit them and make apology and reparation for those hideous crimes in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that they have become frantic in their moves against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK, while persistently peddling the \"abduction issue\" that had already found a solution. This betrays their criminal intention to realize without fail their ambition to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, who set store by the dignity of the Korean nation, will certainly force the Japanese reactionaries to pay for those crimes as they challenge the DPRK, persistently sidestepping the unprecedented crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
