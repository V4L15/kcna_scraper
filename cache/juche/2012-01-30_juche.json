He learned in detail about their training, creating different situations to be settled by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Walking the ground for foot flight training, he praised the airmen for making it part of their daily life to undergo flight training, thinking of the sky awake or asleep. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the kitchen he told the cooks that airmen like food when it is prepared by diverse methods, even if they use the same foodstuff, urging them to prepare meals in such a way as to cater to the taste of the airmen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seated before the table for airmen, he recollected the words of Kim Jong Il that he would invite those airmen who were successful in the training held on Dec. 16 last year to visit Pyongyang, meet them and dine with them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He visited the family of Ho Ryong, commander of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He kindly shook the hand of his wife Kim Jong Sil and went round each room of their house.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo taken with the couple. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went outside when darkness was gathering.

Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a bylined commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean warmongers plan to stage joint landing exercises with the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in the area of Phohang and conduct Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military maneuvers. This suggests what they are after.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the said maneuvers are a replica of Team Spirit joint military exercises as they are a test nuclear war to invade the DPRK through a surprise attack, precision strike and use of troops for a special war and others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean warmongers decided to mobilize U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in case somebody \"starts a local war\" and formally signed \"a joint plan to cope with the local war,\" sharply increasing the danger of accidental military conflicts between the north and the south leading to an all-out war. The U.S. and south Korean militaries refrain from opening the above-said plan to the public in a bid to escape from domestic and foreign protest and denunciation of their dangerous scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation indicates that a war may break out any moment on the Korean Peninsula due to the reckless war hysteria kicked up by the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors in league with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unshakable is the revolutionary will of the DPRK to react to the enemies' provocations with merciless retaliations and thus root out the very source of war so that they may not disturb peace on this land again, concludes the commentary."
