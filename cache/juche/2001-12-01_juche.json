And it is a powerful idea that puts forward the press work as the main front of ideological work and enhances the role of the socialist press in every way to push ahead with revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As there is no limit to the might of the popular masses awakened politically and ideologically, so there is no limit to the ideological might of the revolutionary writing brush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The path covered by Rodong Sinmun is the history of worshipping and defending the leader, which has proudly recorded the glorious revolutionary history of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is because of having them at the head of the party and revolution that Rodong Sinmun could powerfully display its militant might as the organ of the socialist ruling party during the period from its foundation to the publication of its 20,000th issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il set a shining example in leading revolution to victory, always loving the writing brush along with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He sent an immortal letter \"journalists and other pressmen are ideological standard-bearers firmly defending our idea, system and cause\" to the journalists and pressmen, so that they may have a powerful weapon to display the might of the writing brush more fully and proudly to meet the requirement of the present era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The press media including Rodong Sinmun should hold higher the banner of the Juche idea in response to the letter and conduct media activities to make the sound of drums louder all over the country to build a powerful and prosperous country, stresses the editorial.    \r\n\r\n"
