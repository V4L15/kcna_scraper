            "content": "\r\n\r\nPast news\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman on U.S. decision to stop supplying heavy oil \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement as regards the fact that on November 14 the U.S. announced a decision to stop supplying heavy oil to the DPRK from the upcoming December. The U.S. has provided supply of heavy oil to it under the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The decision is a wanton violation of article 1 of the framework which stipulates that the United States of America, representing the Korean Energy Development Organization in accordance with the October 20, 1994, guarantee message of the U.S. President, shall adopt a measure to make for the loss of energy in return for the freezing of the graphite moderated reactors and their related facilities of the DPRK till the completion of light water reactor no. 1 and it shall supply heavy oil for the use of heat and electricity production as alternative energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned article is the only one of the four articles of the framework that has been observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a view to playing down the responsibility for breaking its international commitment, the U.S. described the decision as \"collective will\" of KEDO member nations. It is as clear as noonday that in actuality the U.S. Government made a decision to stop supplying heavy oil before forcing it upon KEDO which is not a signatory of the framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In making public the decision the U.S. claimed that the DPRK violated the framework first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. unilaterally gave up its last commitment under the framework, the DPRK acknowledges that it is high time to decide upon who is to blame for the collapse of the framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known to the world that the U.S. has violated the framework and boycotted the implementation of its commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. has drastically delayed the construction of LWRs, worked out a plan for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and listed the latter as part of an \"axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also well known to the world that the U.S. has so far threatened the DPRK by incessantly staging large-scale nuclear war exercises of various types against the DPRK, a variant of the \"Team Spirit\" war exercise, in South Korea and its vicinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hard-line policy to stifle the DPRK fully betrayed its true colors in the wake of the Bush administration's listing the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and announcement of its plan for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. outcries for disarming the DPRK are, in essence, little short of calling upon the DPRK to abandon its system. This was more clearly evidenced by the statement of the U.S. President issued on Nov. 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. gravely insulted the spirit of the UN Charter by listing a UN member nation as part of an \"axis of evil\", to say nothing of the agreed framework. It also wantonly transgressed the basic spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by singling out nuclear-free states as the targets of its preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has exercised its forbearance to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a view to keeping the AF from being derailed at any cost the DPRK proposed the U.S. for concluding a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. as a way of settling the nuclear issue on Oct. 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty is, in essence, the only realistic solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula as it is aimed to settle the issues caused by the threat from the U.S. by the way of removing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. President and all other authorities said that the U.S has no intention to invade the DPRK. So, if they are sincere in their remarks, there is no reason whatsoever for them not to give legal assurances of non-aggression to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. responded to the DPRK proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with a decision to stop supplying heavy oil to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. assertion that the DPRK violated the framework is a burglary logic of America-style superpower chauvinism that a big country may threaten a small country as it wishes but a small country should not try to cope with such threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks this logic will work on the Korean Peninsula. \r\n\r\n"

It dismissed the South Korean public security authorities' decision to sentence Kim Hyong Ju, chairman of Hanchongryon, to prison terms as a challenge to the desire of the people for a democratic reform, social progress and reunification.\r\n The court bench in a sentence defined the north as \"an anti-state organization\" despite the fact that the south and the north have entered the era of reconciliation and asserted that the security law should be kept so long as there exists a threat of aggression to the south from the north and, accordingly, the  label of an enemy-benefiting organization should remain attached to the tenth-term Hanchongryon as it has shared the same stand with the north, the statement said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the court bench turned away from the fast changing south-north relations and the efforts for peaceful reunification exerted by various social strata in the wake of the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the statement branded its recent sentence as an anachronistic one. \r\n\r\n"
