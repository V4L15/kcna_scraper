            "content": "Es inevitable la ruina del \"poder\" traidor, destaca Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 12 de agosto (ATCC) -- En un articulo individual difundido hoy, el diario Rodong Sinmun subrayo que es inevitable la ruina del \"poder\" traidor del Sur de Corea que se opone a la aspiracion y la demanda de las masas populares.\n\t\t\t\t\t Esta verdad de la historia la comprueba la cada dia mas grave crisis que sufre el \"poder\" conservador surcoreano, senala el articulista y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ahora, debido al fracaso total de sus antipopulares politicas interior y exterior, la banda de titeres surcoreanos cayo en la crisis de gobernacion sin salida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El \"proyecto de enmienda de conformacion de la ciudad de Sejong\", que impulsaba la banda de Lee Myung Bak en contra de la aspiracion y la demanda de la opinion publica, fue echado al basurero de la historia. Y \"el arreglo de cuatro rios\", politica traidora mas representativa, tropieza con el rechazo rotundo de todos los circulos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el seno del \"Gran Partido Nacional\" no cesan las pugnas por el poder y por imputar la responsabilidad del fracaso de las politicas exterior e interior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi que ya fue decidido el destino del \"poder\" traidor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si deja intacta a la banda de traidores, la poblacion surcoreana no podra realizar su deseo de la independencia, la democracia y la reunificacion ni evitar el destino tragico de la victima de la guerra nuclear que desatarian las fuerzas foraneas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, es inevitable que los habitantes surcoreanos se levanten en la lucha pannacional por sepultar a esa camarilla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No hay salvacion para la horda de vendepatrias que dio espaldas a las masas populares y se hizo el blanco de repudio de la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, la banda de Lee Myung Bak se mueve desesperadamente para liberarse de la crisis de destruccion."
