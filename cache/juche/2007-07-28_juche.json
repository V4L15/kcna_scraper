Herein lies the tremendous historic significance of the victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 50-odd post-war years were proud years when the army and people of the DPRK have inherited the great feats performed in the war and tradition provided there and thus performed epoch-making miracles and exploits in the struggles to defend socialism and build a rich and powerful country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the great pride and honor of the army and people of the DPRK to eternally glorify the history of the great victory won in the anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle, blessed by leaders generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only victory and glory are in store for them advancing toward the bright future with full confidence under the great Songun leadership of the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls on all people to eternally glorify the ever-victorious history of Songun Korea, united around Kim Jong Il in single mind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the paper the Japanese reactionaries marked Tok Islet as part of Japan's territory and set it as one of the main tasks of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" to put it under the control of Japan. In a word, Japan proposed to set it as a state policy to seize the islet by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the designation of Tok Islet as territory of Japan again in the \"Defense White Paper for 2007\" clearly reveals the Japanese militarists' ever-more undisguised ambition for reinvasion of Korea, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok Islet is an inalienable part of Korea's territory which has been governed by its people and served the nation along with its long history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan openly claimed dominium over the islet, making far-fetched assertion that it belongs to Japan, thus sparking off territorial dispute with Korea.  The Japanese samurais have left no means untried to occupy the islet, having an eye to it from long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their descendents are now intentionally causing territorial dispute with Korea after setting the \"defence of Tok Islet\" as their state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said Japanese reactionaries' attempt shows that they seek to stage a comeback to Korea any time with the issue of the disputed islet as a pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the white paper, Japan is to push ahead with the establishment of the missile defence system (MD) and partially deploy it for an actual war by this year to cope with the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. This is a military measure aimed to boost capability of attack for reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' designation of Tok Islet as part of Japan's territory and their decision to step up the establishment of MD is a red signal to cause trouble with the DPRK under the pretext of the issue of Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' assertion on \"dominium over Tok Islet\" is aimed to stage a comeback not only to the islet but the whole Korea and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive nature of the Japanese militarists remains unchanged and their moves for reinvasion are getting pronounced as the days go by.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
