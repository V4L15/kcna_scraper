            "content": "KCNA on Japan's dangerous move for \"emergency legislation\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- Recently Japan announced that it would set up examination councils at the ministries and agencies concerned to institute an \"emergency legislation\".\r\n This is a dangerous move to channel all the manpower and material resources of the country into executing a war of aggression  and legally and institutionally guarantee a wartime system and fascistization at home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has already restored the right to participate in war and the right of belligerency by adopting the law related to the updated 1999 \"Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guideline\" and the \"law on emergencies in areas surrounding Japan\". If Japan institutes the \"emergency legislation \" and revises the constitution, it will round off the legal and institutional preparations to launch an overseas aggression any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have always been seized by the revanchist and militarist ambition since their defeat in World War II. Hence, they singled out the institution of the \"emergency legislation\" as a major task of the \"defense agency\" already 25 years ago and have since stepped up preparations for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese chief executive in his policy speech on Jan. 31 underscored again the need to institute the \"emergency legislation\" only to undisguisedly reveal Japan's intention to complete the fascistization and wartime system at home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that they are pushing ahead with these moves under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They still insist that the DPRK's successful launch of a satellite was a \"missile launch\" in a bid to divert elsewhere the watchful eyes of the international community from the institution of the \"emergency legislation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts go to prove that their strategic ambition to lay a military and political foundation for the establishment of their unchallenged position in the Asia-Pacific region remains unchanged and it grows stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to cool their heads preoccupied with aggression and to be prudent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan keeps to the road of militarization as it does now, it will only meet a final ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Gone never to return are the times when a country's arbitrary practices were allowed.    \r\n\r\n"

This only drives the situation in the region to a dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pursuing a \"policy of strength\" to establish its unchallenged domination over the region in the new century. It is going to realise this ambition by using Japan, its junior partner, as a \"shock brigade\" for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unchangeable wild ambition of the Japanese reactionaries to realise their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" taking advantage of the U.S. strategy to invade Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are whetting their sword to launch overseas military operations under the signboard of \"joint action\" with the U.S. in case of \"emergencies in surrounding areas.\"    \r\n\r\n"
