            "content": "CPRF blasts \"peace policy\" of Ri Hoe Chang \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in information bulletin no. 822 dismissed the \"peace policy\" set out by Ri Hoe Chang on August 21 as sheer sophism intended to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad in a bid to improve his image and realize his ambition to seize power.\r\n The information bulletin said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri talked about \"peace\" as if his sinister intention had changed overnight. But it only reveals his inborn shamelessness and double-dealing nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of peace, the cherished desire of the Korean nation, has not yet been solved. It is not due to lack of principle or option for it but because the United States persistently barred Koreans from realizing their desire for peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If genuine peace and security are to be guaranteed on the Korean Peninsula, first of all, the U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and replace the DPRK-U.S. armistice agreement by a peace agreement and the U.S. troops withdraw from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri, however, kept mum about the U.S. policy of aggression toward the DPRK and the U.S. troops' pullout from south Korea, which are the root cause of disturbing peace, while paying lip-service to peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the long run, his \"peace policy\" is a version of a war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt, therefore, only betrays his intention to pursue the hostile policy toward fellow countrymen, tailing behind the u.s. under the veil of \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri should clearly know he can not escape a lot of an ostracized guy no matter how noisily he vociferates about \"peace\" and any change in his \"policy towards the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is well advised to stop saying empty words about \"peace\" but honestly repent of and apologize for his crime-woven past. \r\n\r\n"

This was declared by Pak Kwang Gi, chief of the Pyongyang mission of the NDFSK, when interviewed by KCNA on August 24 on the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of its foundation.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 30 odd-year-long history of the NDFSK is a glorious history of struggle. In the period it has vigorously advanced along the road indicated by the great Juche idea, an invincible idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il illumined the path to be taken by the NDFSK and the south Korean people on the basis of the Juche idea and instilled the conviction of sure victory and pluck into us with his great leadership and boundless loving care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main factor of landmark events in the revolutionary movement in south Korea is Kim Jong Il's greatness. His greatness, giving an admirable impact to the whole of south Korea, has culminated into worship for him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national democratic movement in south Korea is greeting a new era of change and the anti-U.S. campaign and the national reunification movement are turning into an unprecedented mass movement in terms of its size and form, not minor one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will substantially model itself on the Juche idea and make the south Korean people of all social strata know well about Kim Jong Il's greatness to considerably strengthen the driving force of the revolutionary movement in south Korea.   \r\n\r\n"
