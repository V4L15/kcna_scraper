He held that such moves as political intervention in education and textbook by ultra conservatives of the Liberal-Democratic Party and the New Frontier Party and the blackmail by the right wing should on no account be overlooked.\r\n   Akira Fujiwara, former professor of Hitotsubashi University, said: attacks on textbook in recent two or three years have come from a political purpose for change of people's understanding of history, overseas dispatch of troops and constitutional amendment and from an intention for affirmation of war and military power. \r\n\r\n"

This brings into a bolder relief their shamelessness and craftness.\r\n   Minju Joson says this in a commentary today.\r\n   The daily notes:  We have already made it clear that we have nothing to do with the \"incident\" on the lips of the Japanese authorities. \r\nThey, however, are provoking the dignity of the DPRK with the unclear \"incident\". lurking behind this is their sinister attempt.\r\n   Japan committed the unpardonable crimes against the Korean people in the past. its criminal past cannot be erased nor be buried no matter how long time may pass by. \r\nThe Japanese authorities have not admitted and repented of their crimes but beautified them over half a century after the defeat of Japanese imperialism.\r\n    In a bid to calm down public opinion at home and abroad calling for the liquidation of the past and get out of the tight corner, the Japanese authorities are raising a hue and cry over the fictitious \"incident\" against the DPRK. such smear campaign does not go down with anyone.\r\n   We will surely make Japan pay for the crimes committed by Japanese imperialism. This is the independent right of the DPRK and, at the same time, to  settle the grudge against Japanese imperialism.\r\n   If the Japanese authorities continue to resort to the smear campaign against the DPRK, not making sincere efforts for the liquidation of the past and the improvement of relations with the DPRK, we have no other choice but to understand that Japan is not interested in the improvement of DPRK-Japan relations and wants confrontation with us. \r\n   they must be mindful that their anti-DPRK moves, relapsed into the welter of the south Korean puppets, will bring misfortunes upon themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
