He extended \"sincere congratulations\" to the Korean nation greeting \"the day of liberation\" on behalf of President Obama and Americans.\n\t\t\t\t\t Kerry was so shameless as to appear at a university seminar in Hawaii and claim that the U.S. has a \"willingness to ease\" the strained DPRK-U.S. relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the recent ministerial meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum he became vociferous that the U.S. was not interested in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and, if any, it was concerned for the improved bilateral relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK said in a statement on Wednesday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the Koreans August 15 is the day in which an end was put to the distress-torn history of more than 40 year-long Japanese imperialists' occupation. It is also the day when occupation of south Korea and shame and tragedy of national division began due to the U.S. imperialist aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Kerry \"congratulated\" the Koreans on this seven decade- long history of shame and tragedy. Can there be more unbearable mockery and insult to the Korean nation than this?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already exposed, not content with inventing new moves for stifling the DPRK and sanctions against it, the U.S. is busy staging Ulji Freedom Guardian, the exercises for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack with huge aggression forces including nuclear war hardware involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All of a sudden, these aggressors are waving olive branches with the veil of \"protecting peace\" in a bid to conceal their despicable true colors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kerry toured the U.S. mainland and Asian countries for just three days, donning masks of sheep and wolf bereft of any elementary face and etiquette, to say nothing of his position as diplomatic chief of the \"super power\". His behavior fully revealed once again the U.S. inveterate nature as a hypocrite who has deceived and mocked mankind with all sorts of gimmicks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is dynamically advancing full of dynamism, racing against time. This is winning the admiration of the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an exciting event that declares a total bankruptcy of the U.S. heinous hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. finds itself in a dilemma at present. If the U.S. attempts to make a head-on attack upon the DPRK, it is afraid of merciless retaliatory forces built by dint of Songun. It is not in a position to remain an onlooker to the reality, making a scream as a loser. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. poor position reminds one of the Roman Empire which fell while seeking prosperity through aggression and war and was buried into oblivion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is running helter-skelter, with its future remaining gloomy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What we would like to advice the U.S. once again is that it had better not waste its last energy while pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK which can never be implemented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop playing the disgusting and cheap farce which can never work on anyone, properly understanding who its rival is."

When meeting with the secretary general of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty on August 13, he again pulled up the DPRK over its \"nuclear issue.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since he took office as minister of Foreign Affairs, he has slandered the DPRK, directing the focus of diplomacy to escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He has urged the DPRK to \"dismantle its nukes\" and malignantly slandered its line of developing the two fronts, claiming that \"the north is increasing regional uneasiness by conducting nuclear tests and launching missiles and these are acts of threatening peace not only on the Korean peninsula but in the rest of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a special academic forum he blustered that \"the north counting on nuclear weapons is enveloped in darkness.

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on DPRK's Tradition of Victory over U.S. \r\n Pyongyang, August 20 (KCNA) -- Decades-long history of DPRK-U.S. standoff clearly proves that the victory is a proud tradition of the DPRK and the disgraceful setback is a tradition of the U.S. These law-governed differing traditions will last in the days ahead. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in an article. \n\t\t\t\t\t Neither false propaganda nor frantic campaign of pressure can alter these traditions, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These traditions originate from the Korean War in the 1950s. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ruling quarters of the U.S. termed the Korean War \"forgotten one\". They did so not because the war was short in its period and small in its scale but because they felt very shameful for the U.S. miserable defeat when looking back on the war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the ceasefire the DPRK has always emerged victorious in the standoff with the U.S. and the U.S. has always sustained successive defeats. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many U.S. administrations have been replaced by new ones from Truman's to Obama's. However, the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK has remained unchanged. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to cope with the ever-escalating U.S. nuclear threats, the DPRK was compelled to conduct three nuclear tests. It thus proudly ranked itself among nuclear weapons states. It also emerged a satellite manufacturer and launcher. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile policy toward the DPRK pursued by the U.S. depending on nuclear weapons went totally bust due to its access to nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. goes mad to ignite a new war through a nuclear campaign in collusion with south Korean puppet forces. But it will bring it nothing but a final ruin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will clearly witness a miserable end of the U.S. in the future."
