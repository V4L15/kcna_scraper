The Koreans have already proved this in the course of implementing the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, closely united in the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" Only when all the Koreans who ardently love the country and the nation and value its dignity cooperate with each other can they reliably defend the country's peace and security and dynamically push forward the movement for independent reunification, no matter what ferocious aggressors may attack them and no matter how desperately the anti-reunification forces may work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls on all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to turn out in the movement for achieving the cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism, as required by the June 15 era of reunification guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself.\"    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint slogans serve as a banner of international unity to be held aloft by all the people who advocate independence as they represent the desire of the Korean people and world revolutionary people to eternally glorify the immortal exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung and  leader Kim Jong Il in the efforts to accomplish the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to strengthen the driving force for global independence and increase its role the people of all countries which advocate independence should unite close. Reflected in the joint slogans are the basis on which the anti-imperialist independent forces in our era should achieve unity and an idea concerning the principle of building international revolutionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's idea of achieving international unity is clearly set out in the avowed idea of its foreign policy -- independence, peace and friendship-- clarified in the joint slogans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for realizing global independence represents acute confrontation between the world anti-imperialist independent forces and dominationist forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the progressives are to protect national independence and dignity and attain their independent development they should counter the U.S. imperialist-led dominationist forces' moves for division and dissention and their beat-one-by-one strategy with a strategy of unity. \r\n The joint slogans call on the people in the present times to embody this idea and meet this requirement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people who advocate independence can successfully accomplish the cause of global independence only when they stage a dynamic struggle true to the idea of international unity clarified in the joint slogans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will unite close with them and intensify the struggle to achieve global independence, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Refutes U.S. Anti-DPRK Human Rights Campaign\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) -- The United States has become all the more vicious in its anti-DPRK smear campaign under the pretext of its \"human rights issue.\"\r\n Shortly ago, the U.S. manipulated the Freedom House and other NGOs to hold an \"international conference on the north Korean human rights issue\" and staged such farce as mailing a bundle of letters of complaints. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also instigated Britain and other countries to fabricate and spread sheer fictions about \"illicit dealings\" such as \"counterfeit notes\" and \"drug smuggling.\"\r\n Under the U.S. manipulation Britain referred \"a draft resolution on the north Korean human rights issue\" to the 60th session of the UN General Assembly on behalf of the EU despite the objection of several countries including some EU nations, thus joining the U.S. in its \"human rights\" campaign.\r\n This clearly reveals that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged as it diametrically runs counter to the spirit of the fourth round of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to slander the DPRK and pressurize it at a time when key issues pending solution between the two countries need serious discussion with the fifth round of the six-party talks near at hand. It is virtually intolerable when taking the relations between sovereign states into account and a serious insult to its dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the U.S. \"human rights racket\" is a foolish attempt to escalate pressure upon the DPRK, wrest a \"concession\" from it at the forthcoming six-party talks and, furthermore, realize a \"regime change\" in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The human rights issue has been misused by the U.S. as a means for achieving its political purpose and as leverage for painting its illegal acts for \"regime changes\" in other countries as legitimate acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. objective to realize \"regime changes\" in those countries of politico-economic and strategic importance and in those anti-U.S. independent countries under the pretext of \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end the U.S. adopted the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" last year aimed at \"improving the human rights performance\" in the DPRK and decided to allot tens of millions of dollars for this purpose. Recently the U.S. set it as the ultimate goal of its administration to put an \"end to tyranny\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the notorious \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" has entered the phase of full implementation the U.S. is desperately working to build up public opinion about the \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK among NGOs in the U.S. and \"friendly countries\" such as Britain so as to create an atmosphere favorable for \"international pressure\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous enough for the U.S., the world's biggest human rights abuser, to try to put international pressure upon the DPRK over its \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is truth that the U.S. and Britain are killing innocent civilians almost every day after invading other countries by force under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" and forcing millions to starve to death by applying unreasonable economic sanctions against them. This is the most hideous human rights abuse the international community should call into question among other things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The role played by the U.S. as \"a human rights judge\" characterized by the politicization of human rights, application of double standards and selectivity and arrogant admonition and open interference in other's internal affairs has only touched off mistrust and confrontation among countries, far from improving the human rights performance there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"human rights\" touted by the U.S. are, by no means, for the sake of other countries, but to meet its own interest.  It is no more than a mean political operation to transform the whole world in American style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, it will be hard to expect any progress in solving pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. and that will only adversely affect it should the U.S. and Britain keep going reckless as now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans will never step back from the principle that human rights precisely mean sovereignty but remain strong in their determination to defend Korean-style socialism, their life and soul, at the cost of their life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Through this it seeks to annul the \"pacifist constitution\" which exists in name only and openly launch overseas aggression. \r\n Minju Joson Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries assert that the revision of the constitution is necessary for \"the security of the state and people.\" However, this is nothing but sophism intended to cover up their criminal aim and dodge the protest and denunciation among the public at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither country nor organization in Asia threatens Japan's security and there is no such an urgent situation. On the contrary, peace and security in Asia-Pacific are threatened by Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an ulterior motive of Japan to secure a legal framework for overseas aggression in order to match its capability for military attack that has been bolstered up to the utmost and start overseas aggression as quickly as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as daylight that in case Japan's \"pacifist constitution\" is replaced by a \"war constitution\" it will openly set out on overseas aggression and then this will undoubtedly render the situation in Asia more strained and acute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to emerge a military power and launch overseas expansion should be checked for the sake of peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The armed forces and people of the DPRK are closely watching every move of the Japanese reactionaries for overseas expansion and keep themselves fully ready to counter it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should drop their reckless moves at once, cogitating about the miserable consequences to be entailed by the militarist moves for overseas aggression.         \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
