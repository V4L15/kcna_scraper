Minju Joson Tuesday says this is a signed commentary. \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. exercise of veto on the resolution indicates that it is not interested in the Mideast peace and its loud-mouthed \"respect for human rights\" is nothing but a fig leaf to cover its true colors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the international arena the U.S. does not bother to brush aside whatever proposal neither in line with its interests nor to its liking in handling any international issues no matter how reasonable it is and how urgently the international community requires. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe same can be said of its attitude toward the Kyoto Protocol. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The majority of developed countries of the world agreed to the protocol and took practical measures to implement it but it is only the U.S. which opposed it and pulled out of it in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its real intention is to meet its own interests, utterly indifferent to whether the environment of the earth is protected or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, addressing the meeting of ministers of environment on preventing the global warming held in Nairobi of Kenya, urged the U.S. to return to the protocol and implement it but the U.S. reneged on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and arrogance have reached their height in the international arena as seen above. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that force is the only means of countering the U.S. which behaves as it pleases, showing off its strength, just as a mad dog should be dealt with a stick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better to behave itself, facing up to the situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

With nothing can they cover up their criminal colors, the paper says, and goes on:\r\n The U.S. is extensively shipping weapons into the disputed areas of different countries and regions to aggravate military clashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is clamoring for \"peace\" and \"stability, security\", but its ulterior intention is different. It is seeking military interference and dominationist purpose by inciting disputes and straining the situation in different regions. This is why the U.S. is increasing the export of weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its loud-mouthed \"ensuring of peace\" and \"establishment of democratic order\" are no more than a lie to cover up its military intervention and method of aggression. As seen in the reality, the U.S. imperialists are destroying international peace order and increasing the danger of a war, not trying to keep peace and stability. This is well interpreted by the fact that the U.S. is continuing to expand nuclear arsenals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They set a preemptive nuclear attack as basic war strategy and simplified the procedures of using nuclear weapons so as to employ them against \"hostile states\" at any time. It is to make a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK that they have deployed a large number of nuclear weapons in and around the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Owing to the U.S. moves, numerous nuclear weapons have been stockpiled in different regions of the world, the danger of a nuclear war is increasing and thus humankind is faced with the danger of nuclear holocaust.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

People call this a miracle. It is proper to say the more than six decades during which north has been in stand-off with the U.S. should be called an uninterrupted miracle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nation is immensely fortunate to have Chairman of the National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il. It is thanks to him that the north which has stood in acute confrontation with the U.S. provided an invariable genuine line of national independence rooted among the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. could not shake the resolution of Kim Jong Il not even once, nor even a moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the Korean nation is led by him, it will rise as a great prosperous powerful nation and build a powerful unified state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, he represents our nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to him that the Korean nation has emerged a dignified and strong nation in the world political arena and it has a rosy future when the country will become one, exercising the national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is the genuine leader of our nation, creator of happiness and defender of justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has opened a bright future of a reunified country.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This high-handed military action is brutal international terrorism and a war of aggression to stifle the anti-imperialist independent countries and realize their wild ambition to dominate the world. This anti-terror war launched by them is now fated to meet a debacle. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. \r\n It goes on: The Iraqi war has brought to daylight the reactionary and dangerous nature of the anti-terror war. The U.S. imperialists did not bother to commit monstrous crimes against civilians in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their anti-terror war of aggression has brought huge casualties and material losses to them and triggered off an unbroken occurrence of bloody terrorism worldwide, sending shivers down the spine of people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said war fought by the Bush administration has caused irretrievable serious consequences to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strong voices critical of the war are heard from the U.S., UK and other allies as its reactionary and dangerous nature has been brought to bold relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The results of the midterm Congressional election in the U.S. that culminated in the defeat of the Republican Party on November 7 clearly indicated that Americans are opposed to the above-said war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. now finds itself in a very difficult position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tight-corned at home and abroad, Bush at last instructed his confidents to reexamine the administration's Iraqi policy and had no alternative but to fire Rumsfeld as defense secretary though he has more faithfully executed its anti-terror strategy than any others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world public is becoming increasingly assertive that chief criminals of this war should be sternly judged as it is a criminal war against humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the immutable law governing the development of history that justice is bound to prevail over injustice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration would be well advised to stop at once its anti-terror war fated to meet a fiasco, bearing this truth in mind.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
