            "content": "Investigador del IDP publica comentario sobre la situacion critica de Park Geun-hye\r\nPyongyang, 12 de noviembre (ACNC) -- El investigador del Instituto de Desarme y Paz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, Jong Kil Song, publico el dia 12 un comentario intitulado \"El trato con la traidora Park Geun-hye a punto de arruinarse no traera nada mas que la verguenza y la deshonra\". \n\t\t\t\t\tEl texto senala como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa traidora surcoreana Park Geun-hye, que no puede eludir el enterramiento politico por su inaudito fraude politico, volvio a pronunciar un disparate contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos en que se encuentra bajo la avalancha de criticas por el escandalo politico que consterna a todo el mundo y se le acerca la severa sentencia del pueblo, ella hablo con un huesped extranjero sobre el futuro de alguien y los efectos de la sancion y presion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una conducta astuta para distraer la atencion de la opinion publica que insiste en que para la mandataria Park, la unica manera de pedir disculpas sinceramente al pueblo es retirarse ahora mismo del poder y someterse con gusto al castigo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, la traidora viene hablando del cambio de la RPDC segun el consejo de su mentora bruja, pero el que esta por arruinarse es el poder titere de ella abandonada por la poblacion surcoreana por los escandalos de toda indole. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridiculo el proceder de algunos paises que depositan alguna esperanza en las irrealizables promesas de cooperacion economica que hace ella. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi estos paises, tentados por un punado de dinero, se ponen de acuerdo con los disparates del cadaver vivo Park, sufriran tremenda pena y verguenza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActualmente, hasta el amo norteamericano desprecia a su lacaya. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn pais, que este interesado en la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana y el resto de la region, debera ver correctamente la posicion estrategica y la realidad de la RPDC y establecer la politica conveniente."
