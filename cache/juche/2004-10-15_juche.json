            "content": "FM  Spokesman Assails Biased Attitude of Some Forces of IAEA \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Thursday as regards the improper attitude of the United States and some forces of IAEA toward the nuclear issue of south Korea:\r\n Since the disclosure of the secrete nuclear-related experiments in south Korea the world public has become evermore suspicious that south Korea has pushed forward its nuclear weapons development plan in secrecy since the 1970s and might have fully acquired the capacity to manufacture them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some forces of the IAEA, however, are becoming all the more undisguised in their moves to cover up the secrete nuclear experiments in south Korea as quickly as possible at any cost, deliberately playing down the gravity of those experiments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are working hard to assuage the importance of inspection of secret nuclear experiments in south Korea even before it came to an end, claiming that the south Korean nuclear activities were mere experiments by individual scholars and the third round of inspection slated for October is according to a regular procedure, not because the earlier two rounds of inspection proved insufficient. They do not hesitate to use the universally known legitimate nuclear activities of the DPRK as a leverage for covering up the south Korean nuclear issue, asserting that it is fundamentally different from the DPRK's nuclear issue as it does not comparison with the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even Director General of IAEA Baradei is busying himself to create impression that the settlement of the nuclear issue is delayed owing to the DPRK, blustering that the international community is losing patience as regards the DPRK over the issue of the six-party talks and now is the time for the UN Security Council to act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. surfaced due to the hostile policy of the Bush administration towards the former and the six-party talks could not make any progress owing to its behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The biased attitude of some forces of IAEA cannot be interpreted otherwise than an abnormal move which has nothing to do with the mission and impartiality of the UN specialized organization whose mission is to prevent nuclear proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not a member of NPT and withdrew from IAEA ten years ago. As the DPRK has already clarified, it has nothing to do with IAEA as an umbrella has nothing in common with fish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, some forces of IAEA are remaining hostile toward the DPRK engaged in just activities, neither knowing where they stand nor mentioning even a word about the unjust behavior of the U.S. In consequence, the issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula is facing a new challenge and the prospect of its settlement is becoming gloomier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some forces of IAEA should bear in mind the adverse impact their double standards will have on the security in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We would like to take this opportunity to state that we cannot overlook the irresponsible attitude taken by Baradei, ignoring the reality and forgetful of his duty. He expressed \"serious concern\" at a time when the south Korean nuclear issue cropped up, but as soon as U.S. State Secretary Powell made remarks defending south Korea he made an about-face and pointed an accusing finger at the DPRK. This goes to prove that he serves the U.S., forgetting his position of director general of IAEA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will continue to closely follow the results of the probe into the south Korean nuclear issue, expecting that IAEA would return to its true mission and the principle of impartiality, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This will only push the situation to a very dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, senior officials of the U.S. vied with each other in making much ado in a bid to shift the blame for the delayed next round of the six-party talks on to the DPRK and pressurize it to come out to the negotiating table. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration opted to scuttle talks from the very day it took office, totally ignoring the DPRK-U.S. agreements made in the days of its preceding administration. The Bush bellicose group did not regard the DPRK as its dialogue partner, to begin with, by defining it as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack. The construction of light water reactors (LWR) which the U.S. had promised to provide to the DPRK ended in its groundwork and the U.S. unilaterally suspended the supply of heavy fuel oil to the DPRK, the only commitment which Washington had implemented under the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, thus scrapping the AF in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which destroyed the groundwork of the six-party talks laid with much effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side unwillingly came out to the talks from the contradictory stand that \"contacts are possible but negotiations are impossible\" and declared that it would not have any negotiations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilaterally backpedaled the agreements and promises already made at the talks. At the third round of the six-party talks all the participating sides unanimously agreed on the principle of \"words for words\", \"action for action\" and \"reward for freeze\". But no sooner had the talks closed than the U.S. officially clarified once again its political stand that there would be no reward for north Korea's nuclear freeze. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with slinging mud at the DPRK, the U.S. went the lengths of letting loose a string of malignant vituperation against the supreme headquarters of the DPRK. It even adopted an act called \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" in a bid to spend a huge amount of fund for its anti-DPRK sabotage operation out of its government budget. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to order the DPRK to kneel down before it and respond to a \"dialogue\" while sitting in a chair. It is a gross miscalculation and a pipedream to calculate that this American way of thinking will work on the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
