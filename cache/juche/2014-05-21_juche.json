            "content": "Kim Jong Un Looks round Construction Site of Apartment Houses for Educators\r\n Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA) Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, looked round the construction site of apartment houses for educators of Kim Chaek University of Technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the site, he learned in detail about the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He was pleased to see the high-rise apartment houses. He said that the buildings with curved surface of their outer walls look like a sailing ship afloat on Taedong River, adding that they are fashionable structures reflecting the party's intention to steadily improve formative art in architecture and masterpieces demonstrating the architecture of the DPRK rapidly developing after the workshop for workers in the field of construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that shops and other welfare and service  facilities on the ground floor of the apartment houses look nice and stable and entrance between corridor and drawing room has been constructed well, he praised the soldier-builders for constructing them as required by the design ratified by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the work-style of the soldier-builders of KPA Unit 267 to fully meet the requirements of the construction method and successfully ensure the safety of the structure, holding high the slogan 'Let us take responsibility for the safety of the project and guarantee its absolute quality for all eternity', he said, calling on all those in the construction field to learn from their work style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction to push ahead with the frame project and inside and outside plastering and the production of furniture at the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As I always emphasize, in order to achieve successes in scientific research it is necessary to solve in a responsible manner the issue of living of scientists and researchers who conduct it, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nothing to spare for the educators dedicating their whole life to training talents of the country, he said, noting it is the party's intention to build lots of such apartment houses to provide them to teachers and researchers in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to construct more apartment houses for the teachers and researchers of Kim Chaek University of Technology so that they may conduct education and scientific research free from worries in their living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said a new street would be formed on the bank of River Taedong if more apartment houses for 500 families of the educators of Kim Chaek University of Technology and service facilities appear with the apartment houses now under construction as an axis. He added that it was good to call it \"Mirae Kwahakja (Future Scientists) Street\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for making the layout of the interior and exterior of the street at the best level and thereby using their construction as an occasion in making a revolution in the construction once again. He proposed completing the construction by the Day of the Sun (birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung) next year by sending a powerful building force made up of service personnel to the construction site of the street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he would examine and decide on the issue of building more apartment houses for 500 families of educators of Kim Il Sung University as soon as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the soldier-builders to complete the construction of the apartment houses for the educators of Kim Chaek University of Technology by the founding anniversary of the WPK so that they may be provided to educators and researchers of the university. He expressed his expectation and conviction that KPA Unit 267 would realize the intention of the WPK in practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Thae Bok, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, and Lieut. General Ma Won Chun, director of the Designing Department of the National Defence Commission."

From this very moment, all warships of the south Korean puppet navy, big and small, which recklessly maneuver in the sensitive waters of the southwestern front, hot spots, will become without exception targets of the direct sighting firing by all strike means under the above-said Command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warships of the puppet navy recklessly maneuvering at the direct instigation of the military hooligans are the root cause of military provocations deliberately straining the situation in the above-said hot spots and they are, therefore, targets of physical strikes which should be blown up without fail. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  2. The south Korean side will face military strikes of the KPA without any warning at the moment the latter detects any trifle provocation near the maritime guard demarcation of its army and around the five islands in the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the most urgent task for providing a sure guarantee for the peace of the country and the security of the nation to put under control the reckless preemptive firing, the height of confrontation with compatriots, in advance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. We unhesitatingly clarify before the world our will to settle accounts with the villains of the south Korean puppet army right now if they are to fight us at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We advise them not to fire bullets and shells in the back lane awkwardly and cowardly but seek a formal military solution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This stand is based on our resolute decision to wipe out the sworn enemy, confrontation maniacs, on this land to the last man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The determined and practical military actions on the Southwestern Front of the KPA will help people clearly see in reality who will disappear and who will tower high on the ground and in the sea."
