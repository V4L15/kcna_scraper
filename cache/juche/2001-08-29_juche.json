He set forth important tasks to be fulfilled to increase the combat capacity of the posts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After learning about the revolutionary and class education at the posts, he highly appreciated the class education being conducted at the posts in diverse forms and ways and in a unique manner to suit the characteristic features of young soldiers.    He underscored the need to pay primary attention to ideological education and train all soldiers to be  ideologically strong fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round their bedroom, mess, daily provision store, washroom and other logistic facilities to learn in detail about the supply service at the posts and take warm care of their living with paternal affection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave them a pair of binoculars, a machine gun and an automatic rifle as gifts and posed for a souvenir picture with them at a trench on the height.    \r\n\r\n"

Meanwhile, the commander of the U.S. forces in Japan stressed the need to strengthen the bilateral military cooperation based on the \"U.S.-Japan guidelines for military cooperation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This evidently shows that the united states is keen to strengthen its military ties and conspiracy and round off its military integration with Japan by instigating the Japanese militarists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the revision of article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which \"bans the exercise of the right to collective self-defence\", will enable the Japanese reactionaries, always preoccupied by revanchism and militarism even after Japan's defeat in the war, to rapidly step up its rearmament and the moves to turn it into a military power. And it will also provide a legal guarantee for their legitimate overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to establish the Missile Defence system (MD) at any cost for the execution of its world strategy and puts forward Japan seized by militarism as a shock brigade for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is evidenced by its assertion that the establishment of MD means to \"build a shield protecting Japan's territory from ballistic missile attack\" and an obstruction to the MD development is a present interpretation of article 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a \"plan for mutual cooperation\" based on \"the U.S.-Japan guidelines for military cooperation\", which stipulates Japan's participation and cooperation in any war of intervention to be conducted by the U.S. abroad, will reportedly be submitted to the \"U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee\" for the first time.   This is a step to complete the bilateral military ties and integration, a move in contravention of article 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the Cold War era the United States and Japan justified their \"security treaty\" and military ties based on it as a step to cope with \"threat of the Soviet Union\". after the end of the Cold War they set out the theory of \"threat from North Korea\" to maintain their ties and go ahead with their military integration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their relations are nothing but a dangerous military tie-up aimed at domination over the Asia-Pacific region including the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such military ties have nothing to do with regional peace, security and prosperity.\r\n The U.S. and Japan should immediately stop the moves for military integration which pushes the regional situation to a grave phase.    \r\n\r\n"

The rain which had lasted for a week or ten days stopped all of a sudden and the sun began shining. On seeing these phenomena, Russians praised him as a legendary great man capable of controlling nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When he visited the Omsk state science library named after Pushkin, the guide said that Jo Ki Chon, a revolutionary poet of Korea, was \"Mayakovski of Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On hearing this, Kim Jong Il explained that Jo was \"Pushkin of Korea\" and made a proper appreciation of his exploits and talent. The officials of the library were deeply admired by his warm love of the nation and highly praised him as a genius of literature produced by mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is also an anecdote about his visit to the Mausoleum of Lenin to pay homage to Lenin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ritbinov, first vice-editor-in-chief of the newspaper Patriot, said that Kim Jong Il's visit to the mausoleum of Lenin signified that the leader of the world cause of socialism declared victory of socialism on red square in Moscow and indicated the way of winning victory of socialism to the communists and the people of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is an anecdote about the leadership trait of Kim Jong Il who always links whatever he sees or has in mind with the interests of the Korean revolution and the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While conversing with the mayor of the city of St. Petersburg Kim Jong Il raised a question about a turbine with its rotator having an angle of 45 degrees. This made Russians keenly realize what great energy and wisdom he is devoting to the development of the power industry in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are anecdotes about what a tight program he had counting every second and minute during his six hour stay in Khabarovsk, how energetically he worked in the entire period of travelling by train, always  doing three or four kinds of work at a time without a moment's rest and what a rich knowledge he had of the world history and what an outstanding insight he had into the present situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
