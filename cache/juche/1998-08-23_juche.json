Korea\r\n  Pyongyang, August 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. military occupation of South Korea is entirely wrong in view of international law and usage, in view of the trend of the international situation and in view of the U.S. responsibility for peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n   The article continues:\r\n   The United States has tried to justify its military occupation of South Korea with unreasonable pretexts.\r\n   In international law on war, there is a principle that warring parties should observe. The principle is that after the end of war, the warring parties should withdraw their troops in order to remove hostile relations and improve bilateral ties.\r\n   All the nations but the U.S. that were involved in the Korean War have totally withdrawn their troops from the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The resolution adopted at the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly in November 1975 calls for dissolving the \"U.N. Command\" in South Korea and withdrawing foreign troops.\r\n   The United States, however, has not fulfilled its obligation.\r\n   The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union deprived the U.S. of the pretext of \"containing the southward thrust of the Soviet Union\" that the U.S. had used for justifying its troops' deployment and arms buildup in South Korea during the Cold War.\r\n   The process of reconciliation and detente is underway in the international arena.\r\n   The United States must make a political decision to renounce its policy of military occupation of South Korea and withdraw its troops from South Korea at an early date.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, 547 mm downpour was recorded in Kaesong in this period. As a result, granaries of Kaesong and south Hwanghae Province including Yonan, Paechon and Chongdan suffered heavy losses in the first ten days of August.\r\n   In early August, Jongju, Pakchon, Sonchon and other granaries of north Phyongan Province had 257 to 300 mm torrential rain, or two or three times the average precipitation. Consequently, these granaries suffered serious losses.\r\n   This year's rainy season is characterized by downpours which fell in some areas periodically.\r\n   During a few months of this year's rainy season, Kosong, Thongchon and other areas of Kangwon Province had 1,052 to 1,473 mm rain which is tantamount to the amount of its annual precipitation. Consequently, much damage such as dead-water and landslides was recorded in the province.\r\n   The agricultural sector suffered heavy losses from hails which came in July.\r\n   On July 3 and 23, hails, 15 millimetres thick, dropped in Jasong county of Jagang Province and Ryongchon county of north Phyongan Province.\r\n   Cold weather was registered on east coastal areas in the period from mid-July till early August.\r\n   Previously, a spell of cold weather occured from early June to early July. \r\n   This year's cold weather had a fatal influence on the agricultural sector.\r\n   From mid-July to early August, threfore, the temperature of the east coastal areas declined 2 or 4 degrees below the average temperature. And the ratio of hours of sunshine was 20 percent lower than the average. Particulary, not a single day was registered in Chongjin and Kilju in the period from late July to early August.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
