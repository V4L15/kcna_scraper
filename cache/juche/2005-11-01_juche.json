            "content": "RS. on Imperial Japanese Army's Biological and chemical War Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- Japan's Tokyo Shimbun recently carried fresh information about the imperial Japanese army's biological and chemical war atrocities in the past.\r\n According to it, the Japanese imperialists organized poison gas warfare units not only overseas but at home and conducted exercises under the simulated conditions of an actual war during the Second World War. It was reported that a booklet discovered in the library of the defence institute of the Japan Defence Agency was a reference book for guiding the education and training of recruits at a poison gas warfare unit called \"mortar regiment No. 1\". The booklet tells how this unit staged exercises under the simulated conditions of an actual poison gas war against the former Soviet Union.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The disclosure of the booklet brought to light once again the truth behind the Japanese imperialists' biological and chemical war, its barbarous nature and their monstrous crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists used Koreans and other Asians as guinea pigs for the tests of germs and poison gas and killed them in a brutal manner. These crimes against humanity still make the people shudder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that materials concerning the crimes related to the Japanese imperialists' germ warfare and the biological and chemical weapons including poison gas bombs stockpiled at that time are still being disclosed one after another though several decades have passed since their defeat suffice to guess the organized nature and scale and brutality of the biochemical warfare committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was something unprecedented in history that the Japanese imperialists committed barbarous biochemical war against Koreans and other Asians in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the Japanese reactionaries have not yet given up their wild dream of reinvading Asia but are keen to impose disasters of the biological and chemical war upon humankind. Japan can never evade its responsibility for the horrendous crimes it committed against the Korean people and other Asians.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Ambition to Become Military Power Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- Japan's ambition to become a military power and expand overseas is an anachronistic daydream, says Minju Joson Monday in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" Japan is trying to extend its term  it is little short of the law on dispatching troops overseas that legalized the overseas dispatch of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" and their military operations. And its new plan for construction of a spacecraft launching ground overseas was prompted by a military attempt to deploy its armed forces of aggression in the favorable regions for military strategy as the U.S. did and step up material preparations to realize its ambition to become a military giant and expand overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's  ambition is very dangerous in view of the present situation in and around Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The tendency of deviation to the Right and militarization is now prevailing in Japan. The Japanese ruling quarters are openly letting loose absurd remarks beautifying their criminal past and the movement for inciting militarism is openly being conducted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In step with this escalating movement at home the Japanese reactionaries are getting over-heated in worsening relations with surrounding countries over the territorial issue and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear what consequences will be entailed by Japan's frantic moves to emerge a military power and realize overseas expansion. \r\n Japan's moves can never be tolerated. Not only the Asian and the world people but also the Japanese people should keep the highest vigilance against the persistent moves of the Japanese reactionaries and thoroughly frustrate them.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
