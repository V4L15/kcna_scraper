He said: The President carried out every job with a noble will and great ideal. He was a possessor of such indomitable spirit as carrying out under any circumstances with strong pluck and full of optimism whatever others considered impossible. He was bold enough to create everything that shook the world. He did everything in such a revolutionary work style that it might be impeccable in all aspects to enable posterity to benefit from it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and belief that the workers of the plant would play a vanguard role in the building of a thriving socialist nation in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam and Hong Sok Hyong, members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Thae Jong Su, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su, department directors of the NDC, and Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK."

            "content": "Inter-Korean Reconciliation and Unity Called for-- Rodong Sinmun\r\n Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- The Koreans from all walks of life in the north and the south and abroad should vigorously turn out in the sacred struggle for peace, reunification and prosperity by pooling their efforts and uniting with each other in patriotism, said Rodong Sinmun in a bylined article Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea released an appeal in the wake of the DPRK joint statement of government, political parties and organizations and the goodwill measures taken to implement it. This appeal is arousing all Koreans to the sacred struggle for tiding over the present grave difficulties and open up a turning phase for independent reunification, the article noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing that all the patriotic-minded Koreans, whether they be authorities or civilians, should join efforts irrespective of differing ideologies and systems and open a turning phase for independent reunification, peace and prosperity, it said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the most pressing task facing all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dialogue and negotiations are the only way for averting war and confrontation and improving the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They serve as the way for hewing out the destiny of the nation. This is proven by the valuable experience gained in the June 15 era of reunification in which the Korean nation had opened the road for independent reunification, peace and prosperity by its concerted efforts. It is also evidenced by the serious lesson taught by the last three years of north-south relations woven with frustration and crisis in vicious circle of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is decisive of north-south dialogue is dialogue between their authorities having power and responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Most of many important affairs vital to the nation can be settled by the authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bilateral and multilateral negotiations should be conducted in a positive way between politicians in the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any politician in Korea should sincerely work for the sake of the nation regardless of class, stratum and partisan interests."
