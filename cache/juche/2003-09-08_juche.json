The recent incident brought into bolder relief the Japanese reactionaries' vicious and sinister aim to deliberately and systematically foster rowdyism of right-wing gangsters under the pretext of \"people's sentiment\" and thus fan up the atmosphere of enmity towards the DPRK in the Japanese society and pursue the confrontation with it to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities can never evade the responsibility for the recent serious anti-DPRK provocation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should bear full responsibility for all the consequences to be entailed by its provocative anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon moves and thoroughly probe the truth behind the provocation, punish those responsible for it and take an immediate measure to prevent the recurrence of such incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will closely follow the Japanese reactionaries' future action.    \r\n\r\n"
