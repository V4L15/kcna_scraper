It is, in fact, turning its back on the dialogue, paying no heed to the demand of the international community for the settlement of the nuclear issue through the direct talks between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is engrossed in adventurous war exercises, aggravating the nuclear crisis with each passing day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talks that it has no intention to invade the DPRK and its call for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue are nothing but hypocrisy and delaying tactics and a fig-leaf to cover up its attempt to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes without saying that the U.S. seeks to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK under the pretext of its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. keen to launch a nuclear war against the DPRK, obsessed by its ambition to dominate the world, is the kingpin of state-sponsored terrorism and evil and the chieftain of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A nuclear war in Korea is unavoidable as long as the U.S. imperialists escalate their military actions for aggression to stifle the DPRK by force.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea joint military exercises flailed worldwide \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- At least 200 media, political parties and organizations and many figures of different social standings in the world strongly condemned the U.S-South Korea joint military exercises staged in South Korea, holding that they were chiefly aimed to ignite the second Korean war.\r\n The Australian newspaper Canberra Times and AFP said that those operations were planned nine months ago and the U.S. and South Korea decided to stage the exercises in order to show that they remain alert on the Korean Peninsula despite the U.S. Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Radio Voice of Russia commented the deployment of more U.S. Forces on the Korean Peninsula is an indication that such military operation as the one against Iraq can be staged on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. newspapers Worker and Worker's World, the Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times, the Mexican newspaper Reforma, the Czech newspaper Halo Noviny and many other newspapers observed that the involvement of large-size bombers and stealth fighters of the U.S. air force in the exercises suggests that they can easily go over to an actual war operation anytime as it is an open warning to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Romanian newspaper Curierul National said Bush's remark that if diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis fail during the joint military exercises, the U.S. may turn to a military option proves that it is going to steadily escalate tensions on the peninsula by staging military exercises in a bid to destroy socialism in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercises were hit as criminal and provocative manoeuvres to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and an extension of the team spirit joint military exercise by many political parties, organizations and personages of the world. They included the Socialist Unionist Party of Syria, the Lebanese Communist Party, the Genuine Lumumbist Patriotic Party of Democratic Congo, the Palestine National Liberation Movement (FATAH), the British Association for Friendship with Korea, the Norway-Korea Friendship Society, the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist), the secretary general of the Arabic Association for Arts, Culture and Information of Egypt, the chairman of the Swiss Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification and the chairman of the Peruvian Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

Thanks to this politics, the revolutionary spirit of soldiers has been created, the military power strengthened considerably on the basis of the self-supporting defence industry and the whole of the country turned into an unconquerable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In January when the U.S. imperialists were threatening the supreme interests of the DPRK under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\", the DPRK government took a just measure to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to defend the sovereignty, existence and dignity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe bold decision was also a product of the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean army and people will never abandon their choice of the Songun politics but fight out the U.S. imperialists and their allies to defend the peace and security of the country.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. military moves around Korean Peninsula flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The U.S. military authorities let loose a spate of sophism that the joint war maneuvers staged in South Korea under the simulated conditions of a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK were aimed to maintain the status quo, were annual ones planned before and had nothing to do with the nuclear issue of North Korea, a clumsy pretext to cover up their aggressive nature and danger. But the U.S. disturbing military moves in and around the Korean Peninsula are a direct product of their strategy to invade the DPRK.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to put the whole of Korea under their control and, furthermore, dominate Asia and the rest of the world. They seek to test their unilateral and arbitrary policy based on strength on the DPRK after singling it out as \"no. 1 enemy\", \"part of an axis of evil\" and their target of a preemptive nuclear attack in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that a war will not break out on the Korean Peninsula where their military moves targeted against the DPRK are going in full gear. They are going to attain their criminal goal through undisguised military actions as their political and diplomatic pressure on the DPRK and moves to suffocate it economically have proved futile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war started by the U.S. imperialists suggests that they, the worst hooligans in the world, may launch a larger war of aggression against the DPRK any time as they attacked a legitimate sovereign state at random, ignoring the United Nations and international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they are mistaken. They should drop their pipedream that their war policy would bring any success in Korea as it did in Afghanistan and Iraq.    \r\n\r\n"

This mass killing is still going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world public is now strongly condemning this barbarism as a most serious violation of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report, however, did not mention such most serious human rights abuses as gravely infringing upon the sovereignty of a country, ignoring the un and wantonly violating international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very strange for the U.S. to not say anything about this genocide while claiming to deal with human rights issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Iraqi war shows, the U.S. is the most serious violator of human rights in our times and it is, therefore, not qualified to talk about human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. efforts to destroy our socialism are as foolish as trying to sweep sea with a broom.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
