            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Political Row over \"Abduction Issue\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, December 30 (KCNA) -- The ultra-right conservative forces of Japan are persisting in their anti-DPRK despicable row over its \"abduction issue\".\r\n They held a \"world meeting urging repatriation of families of those abducted to the north\" in Tokyo on Dec. 22 at which they stressed the need to \"intensify international solidarity\" and \"make joint efforts\" allegedly to prevent the \"tragedy\" of the above-said families. In a nutshell, the \"meeting\" was aimed at wooing international human rights organizations and other organizations to put pressure on the DPRK over the \"abduction issue\".\r\n This is an undisguised challenge to the trend of the times as it is nothing but political rowdyism of the ultra-right conservative forces of Japan who do not know even where they should stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the DPRK-Japan inter-governmental contacts made in Beijing a few days after the meeting, both sides agreed to take measures to settle the pending issues including the issue for normalizing the bilateral relations at an early date in line with the spirit and the basic principle of the Pyongyang Declaration. \r\n The conservative forces of Japan have kept staging the worn-out \"abduction drama,\" swimming against the overall trend of the international community towards reconciliation. This is designed to divert elsewhere the world opinion following the stand and attitude of the two countries while positively assessing the moves to improve the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When their attempt to fake up the second \"abduction case\" involving several countries proved futile, they busied themselves with hosting the \"Osaka meeting\", the \"Tokyo meeting\" and other meetings one after another in a bid to \"put international pressure\" on the DPRK.\r\n They are zealously toeing the U.S. line to internationally isolate and stifle the DPRK after listing it as a \"terrorist state\" under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous for Japan, a political dwarf, to curry favor with the U.S., its master, and get a sort of political reward from the latter.\r\n It is quite preposterous and unreasonable for Japan to seek to \"internationalize the abduction issue\" as it has heavy historical responsibility and moral obligation to settle its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet redeemed the hideous crimes it has perpetrated by forcibly drafting and abducting Koreans in the last century. However, it has not done away with its criminal disposition of abducting people as evidenced by the recent abduction of An Phil Hwa, a Japanese woman in the DPRK.\r\n The Japanese ultra-right forces are so brazen-faced as to insist only on the already settled \"abduction issue\" in a bid to get on the nerves of the DPRK, keeping mum about their inglorious \"past.\" This behavior cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate attempt to block the forthcoming inter-governmental contact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan truly wants to make a policy switchover in the hope of warming up the bilateral relations as desired by the international community and the two peoples in the new century, it should stop the \"abduction\" racket at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
