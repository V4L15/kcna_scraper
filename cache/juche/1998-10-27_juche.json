The manoeuvres, which began on October 26, will last till November 6. \"98 Hwarang\" war game involving regular and irregular armed forces, more than 1.1 million in all, is being staged, synchronised with \"98 Foal Eagle.\"\r\n   \"98 Foal Eagle\" and \"98 Hwarang\" manoeuvres are all unpardonable because they are designed to provoke a war against the north.\r\n   The above-mentioned manoeuvres eloquently prove that the U.S. is a source of aggression and war. While paying lip-services to \"detente\" and \"peace\" on the Korean peninsula at the \"four-party talks,\" the U.S. has run amuck to aggravate tensions and unleash a war against the north.\r\n   Kim Dae Jung-led bellicose group is trying hard to strangle the fellow countrymen, turning the whole South Korea into a war theatre of the U.S. aggression forces against the north. Its act reveals with added clarity the true colors of the \"government for the people\" as a herd of vicious anti-reunification warmaniacs.\r\n   The U.S. must have a good knowledge of the unanimous and firm will of our people to reunify the divided country independently and in a peaceful way and put an immediate halt to the reckless manoeuvres to provoke a war against the north. It also must immediately pull its forces out of South Korea whose presence in South Korea can not be justified in any case.\r\n   Kim Dae Jung-led warmaniacs should act with discretion, mindful that their efforts to realise the U.S. design of aggression to plunge the fellow countrymen into the holocaust of nuclear war will only precipitate their destruction. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they are openly watching and shadowing Chongryon officials and Japan-resident Koreans and blocking business activities of Korean traders and industrialists in every way.\r\n   Chongryon is a dignified overseas Koreans' organisation under the DPRK's legal protection. \r\n   Accordingly, the Japanese authorities should  protect Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. This is an international obligation and legal responsibility of Japan.\r\n   Nevertheless, Japan is engaged in a frantic anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon racket.\r\n   Its is an outrageous act against international usage and morality and ethics and an unpardonable challenge and provocation against the DPRK.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries persist in their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves in disregard of our warnings, they will be made to pay dearly for their criminal acts including the past crimes against the Korean nation. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
