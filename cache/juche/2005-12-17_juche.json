            "content": "\"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" Termed Illegal\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- The \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" was the most fraudulent document aimed at removing Korea from the surface of the earth and reducing the Koreans to pitiful slaves of Japan. This was clear historic evidence that laid bare the sinister, crafty and shameless nature of the Japanese imperialists.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treaty fabricated by the Japanese imperialists was a totally illegal document because they regarded the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty having no diplomatic right to independently conclude any treaty with a foreign country at that time as a contracting party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was also illegal as it was concluded in a coercive manner in face of military threat and a sheer fabrication because it completely ignored the procedures necessary for concluding an international treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said feudal government was deprived of its diplomatic right by the Japanese imperialists under the \"1905 Five-Point Treaty\". It was, therefore, clear to everyone that any country deprived of diplomatic right is not in a position to conclude any treaty with other countries legally. \r\n The Japanese imperialists amassed at least 2,600 aggressor troops in the area of Seoul from May to July, 1910 with an aim to brutally suppress the possible anti-Japanese actions of the Korean people around the time Korea was \"annexed\" to Japan and carry out this process with ease by threatening the feudal ruling quarters of the Ri dynasty by force of arms and bringing them to their knees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treaty was a false document as it lacked the ratification by the head of state of Korea, the most important element in the publicly recognized procedures for concluding any international treaty at that time. The Japanese imperialists thus wantonly violated the territory and sovereignty of the Korean nation by force of this fraudulent treaty. This crime remains unpardonable no matter how much water may flow under the bridge.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
