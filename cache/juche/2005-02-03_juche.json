And this is the second act of aggression which is little different from the Japanese imperialists' installment of the building of their \"government-general\" in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is what the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland says in its information bulletin No. 895 Tuesday as regards the fact that the U.S. has recently pressurized the south Korean authorities to offer 24,000 phyong within the Ryongsan base in Seoul as the new building lot of its embassy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the early 1980s, the bulletin notes, the U.S. chose the site of the Toksu Palace, one of the precious historic and cultural heritages of the Korean nation, as the building lot of its embassy, intending to construct its embassy building and apartment houses for its staff members, but failed to realize its sinister scheme in face of the strong protest of the south Korean people. It left the matter undecided till it chose a vast area more than treble the original embassy building lot within the Ryongsan base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ryongsan in Seoul is a place of disgrace symbolical of the violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation by outside forces. It is the place where the Japanese imperialists, during their occupation of Korea, set up the main organs for their colonial rule such as the \"government-general\" and the command of Japanese troops stationed in Korea and enforced its policy of colonial enslavement against the Korean nation and it is also the very place where the U.S. imperialists, after setting foot in south Korea in\r\nplace of Japanese imperialism after the liberation of Korea, installed the U.S. Eighth Army Command, the \"UN Command\", the south Korea-U.S. \"Joint Command\", etc. for their military occupation and colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people from all walks of life should reject the U.S. domination and intervention, build a fiercer flame of struggle for independence against the U.S. to get the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea and, for the present, resolutely shatter the U.S. moves to wrest Ryongsan again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities must stop at once their pro-U.S. submissive act of leaving the inviolable land of the country to the tender mercy of the U.S. imperialist aggressors, facing up to the trend of the times and popular sentiments for independence and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This anti-DPRK hysteria diametrically runs counter to the present international environment and atmosphere and a deliberate and premeditated vicious plot to scrap the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which both sides promised to observe international law and refrain from any act of threatening each other's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling the fact that whenever an opportunity presented itself, the Japanese reactionaries threatened to take �gadditional measures�h and apply �geconomic sanctions�h against the DPRK if it does not meet their demands, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified more than once that it would regard any sanctions as a declaration of a war against it and take legitimate self-defence measures to cope with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defying this warning, the Japanese reactionaries do not hide their intention to take a measure for sanctions against the DPRK. This is nothing but a reckless and extremely provocative act to unilaterally and completely nullify the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and push the DPRK-Japan relations of confrontation to an explosive point.\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries calculate that they can achieve their sinister aim by further straining the relations with the DPRK through sanctions, not away from their viewpoint dating back to the old era, nothing will be more naive and foolish calculation than this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are becoming increasingly assertive that it should not deal with Japan any longer, disgusted with its perfidious and despicable attitude.\r\n The DPRK is set to decisively counter Japan�fs moves to apply more sanctions against it with a strong physical measure.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Herein lies the great significance of the general march of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members, servicepersons and people should firmly arm themselves with the Songun idea of the WPK and become ardent adherents to this idea, who think and act, guided by it, staunch defenders of the Songun policy and faithful implementers of the Songun revolutionary line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should deeply trust leader Kim Jong Il only and unite closer around him and make the spirit and trait of the single-minded unity perfectly prevail throughout the society while decisively combating the enemy's vicious psychological warfare aimed at disintegrating our revolutionary ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people should attach importance to the military affairs and earnestly learn them to thoroughly implement the WPK's policy of putting all the people under arms and fortifying the whole country. They should give top priority to the development of the national defence industry in hearty response to the line of economic construction in the Songun era advanced by the WPK and thus make a positive contribution to increasing the nation's military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to reenergize the national economy as soon as possible and turn it into a modern economy in the 21st century by fully displaying the revolutionary soldier spirit, the reporter called for implementing to the letter the WPK's policy of the agricultural revolution, in particular, to solve the food problem our own way at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to make a leaping advance and innovations in the economic construction in the spirit of self-reliance based on uptodate science and technology and make the spirit of the times and the revolutionary optimism and rich emotion of the revolutionary fighters of Songun prevail throughout the society, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attending the meeting were senior officials of the Party, the state and the army, chairpersons of friendly parties, Cabinet members, and officials of the army and various public circles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting continues.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
