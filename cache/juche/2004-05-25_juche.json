The prosecution charged him with leading a demonstration against the passage through the \"National Assembly\" of the \"agreement on free trade\" in front of the South Kyongsang Provincial Government Office in June last year when he was active as chairman of the provincial federation of the National Federation of Peasants Associations.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The statement said the U.S. ambassador refused the open interview because \"he had neither justification nor confidence to persuade our people about the stand of his country\" owing to the stabbing of a south Korean civilian by U.S. soldiers in Sinchon, opening to the public of the truth behind the U.S. maltreatment of Iraqi POWs and growing anti-American sentiments in south Korea. The statement warned that if the U.S. ambassador tried again to force south Korea to additionally dispatch troops to Iraq after refusing the open interview, the U.S. would face a powerful anti-U.S. struggle of Hanchongryon and all the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, more than 60 percent of 157 officials of civic and public organizations including the (south) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the Institute of National Affairs and the Citizens' Solidarity for Democratic Society polled on May 19 by south Korean Internet radio People's Voice as regards problems to be solved by the 17th \"National Assembly\" called for abolishing the Security Law and retracting the decision on additional troop dispatch to Iraq.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean people regard socialism as their life and soul and absolutely trust and protect it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the Bush administration seldom misses a chance to spread misinformation about \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK and is getting more vociferous about it these days than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives at its hearing on \"human rights situation in north Korea and the issue of its defectors\" on April 28 recommended the administration to focus international attention on this issue. Later U.S. politicians instigated the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution calling for mounting a human rights offensive against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is escalating such human rights offensive against the DPRK at a time when its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" has proved futile. This smear campaign is, therefore, aimed to tarnish the international image of the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\" and divert the unbiased world opinion critical of GIs' abuses of Iraqi detainees to the DPRK. At Iraqi prisons GIs undressed male and female prisoners and resorted to all sorts of indecent practices. They let loose dogs to bite Iraqis and even killed them in cold blood. The atrocities committed by GIs are unheard-of human rights abuses which can never be justified. They are a violation of the world conventions on the treatment of POWs, a wanton breach of morality and a total negation of Islamic ethics and culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keeping 9,000 persons behind bars overseas and resorting to all sorts of maltreatment. This clearly indicates how seriously it is violating human rights worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to evidently prove that the U.S. is, indeed, the world's worst violator of human rights and a graveyard of human rights and that the U.S.-loudmouthed \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" are no more than hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration is working hard to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the \"human rights issue,\" behaving as if it were a \"human rights judge\", despite strong the world public criticism of its human rights abuses. Its hostile policy toward the DPRK is, however, bound to go totally bankrupt.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
