It is necessary to finish the construction of the terminal to be an icon of Songun Korea, the face of the country and the gateway to Pyongyang and properly distribute service network and facilities and build them to be impeccable so that they may provide the best convenience to the passengers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed officials to stop for the time being the finishing project of the interior now under way, examine layout designs and complete the modified ones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the runway of Pyongyang International Airport which has been completed, in the main, he learned about its paving and various markings. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the runway extending far away with satisfaction, he noted with pleasure that the reconstruction in a modern way  of the runway on which President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il left inerasable footprints for the cause of independence against imperialism and the cause of world revolution made it possible to add brilliance to their  undying leadership feats. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the soldier- builders for successfully building the runway as intended by the party and gave an instruction to qualitatively wind up the remaining project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he examined a relief model of the area of the airport and set forth a task for developing it as required by the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He clarified his idea of building in the future a new terminal and runway opposite to the airport now under construction and railways for express train and highway from the heart of the capital city to the airport to turn it into the world-class one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to build the area of the airport in such a way as to make it look magnificent and fashionable so that it may show the proud appearance of the DPRK's socialist system and the standard of a highly civilized nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also gave an instruction to facelift the Sunan area, build peculiar green houses in the farm field of Sunan district near the airport and convert Thaekam-ri and Wonhwa-ri associated with the leadership feats of the President and Kim Jong Il into model farms of the world level. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He indicated tasks and ways for the development projects including the issues of properly deciding the order of priority in developing the area of the airport, working out best  designs, fixing  time for groundbreaking and taking measures for providing manpower and building materials, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Premier of the Cabinet Pak Pong Ju, Vice-Marshal of the KPA Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Kim Nung O, vice department director of the Central Committee of the WPK, and Lieut.

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Saturday released a statement clarifying a crucial stand of the DPRK assailing the south Korean puppet authorities for persistently shielding and encouraging the another  leaflet scattering operation conducted by human scum in the area of Phochon of Kyonggi Province at midnight of Friday. \n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. The south Korean authorities should know that there will be neither dialogue between the north and the south nor improvement of the inter-Korean relations unless they suspend the leaflet scattering operation malignantly hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakable will and steadfast principled stand of the army and people of the DPRK not to pardon at any cost whoever defames the dignity of its supreme leadership. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not even dream of sitting at the negotiating table with us as long as a reckless leaflet scattering operation goes on. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should not forget that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK declared they would not only make sighting strikes at balloons but also blow up their base and strike the forces commanding their operations behind the scene if the leaflet scattering goes on. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The KPA will sternly punish and finish off those criminals involved in those operations in the name of all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have the right to punish the criminals who fled to the south after committing crimes against its social system and its law and the south Korean authorities are obliged to extradite the criminals to the north side in the light of international law and practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the south Korean authorities are not ready to do so, we will conduct an operation to decisively punish the human scum. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. We will file a suit in the international organizations including the UN and world community against the south Korean authorities' leaflet scattering operation against the DPRK in an effort to build strong public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said operations for defaming the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system of the DPRK and its people being perpetrated in south Korea under the patronage of the puppet authorities are hideous crimes against humanity and human rights as they are a grave violation of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the south Korean puppet group which should be brought to an international court. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will file a complaint in the international organizations and the world community against the puppet group's hostile act of seriously infringing upon the universally accepted international norms and order and strongly censure and condemn it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement warned that the Park Geun Hye group will have to pay a dear price for scuppering the hard-won opportunity of improving the north-south relations and trampling down the compatriots' desire for reunification by making a mockery of the DPRK's good faith and challenging it."
