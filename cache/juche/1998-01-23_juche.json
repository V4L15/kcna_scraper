He learned about the construction and expressed great satisfaction.\r\n   He then visited the Kanggye Tractor Complex, the February Steel Complex, the February 8 Machine Complex and the Kanggye Precision Machine Complex, met with workers and learned about the production.\r\n   He met with model workers of the February 8 Machine Complex and the Kanggye Precision Machine Complex and had pictures taken with them.\r\n   After grasping the economic situation of the province, he gave important tasks to various domains of the national economy.\r\n   The WPK members and other working people in the province were trained further politically and ideologically, made enormous achievements in different domains and laid solid foundations for a great upswing in socialist economic construction through a hard and difficult drive to victoriously conclude the \"ardous march,\" he said, adding that this eloquently demonstrates the strength of the ideology, unity and will of the Korean people who have bravely pulled through rigorous trials of history and risen up with redoubled courage.\r\n   He laid down tasks for realizing the electrification of the country at an early date.\r\n   Efforts should be channelled into creating a new generating capacity to complete the electrification of the country on a high level, he said.\r\n   In Jagang Province many minor power stations of various types have been built so that the problem of power is solved and sufficient electricity is supplied for heating in houses and people's life, he noted, and added that this is patent proof of the validity and great vitality of President Kim Il Sung's instructions that minor power stations as well as large ones should be built extensively.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il said minor power stations are good in various aspects as they turn out much electricity, provide conditions for fish culture and beautify the landscape. He called on all provinces, cities and counties to follow the example of Jagang Province.\r\n   He stressed that the whole party, the whole country and all the people should launch a national campaign to build minor power stations.\r\n   He put forward tasks for keeping a high and steady rate of production by tapping the potentials of the industry to the maximum.\r\n   He urged the factories and enterprises in the province to continuously implement the party's economic policy of maintaining the Juche character and national identity in the industry and tap inner reserves positively so that the existing economic foundations may pay off.\r\n   The working class of Korea should give full play to their heroic stamina and invincible might again in today's worthwhile forced march for the final victory the way they built socialism from scratch in the 1950s, he said.\r\n   He gave tasks to boost agricultural production.\r\n \r\n"
