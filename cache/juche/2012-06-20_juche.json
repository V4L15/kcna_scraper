In the 1970s and 1980s it escalated sanctions against the DPRK in all fields of economy such as trade, investment, insurance, credit, loan and lease on the strength of the Trade Act, the \"Foreign Economic Emergency Measure Act\" and the \"Export and Import Bank Act\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Jan. 20, 1988 the U.S. groundlessly labeled the DPRK as \"a sponsor of terrorism\" and invoked all sanction acts including the \"Foreign Aid Act\", the \"Arms Export Control Act\" and the \"International Banking Organs Act\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the Geneva DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework in October 1994 the U.S. promised to provide light water reactors to the DPRK. But, it dragged on the project and finally stopped it, laying big obstacles to the DPRK's development of self-supporting nuclear energy industry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers cooked up anti-DPRK resolutions 1718 and 1874 at the UN Security Council meetings in 2006 and 2009, groundlessly pulling up it over its nuclear test for self-defence and launches of satellites for peaceful purposes, slapping new harsh sanctions on it worldwide. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In April this year they cooked up the UNSC presidential statement \"critical\" of the launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3, kicking off an anti-DPRK campaign calling for additional sanctions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its followers upon the DPRK involve not only the military field but almost all other fields. Restrictions and embargo are imposed upon all things ranging from materials necessary for people's living to delivery of major industrial   equipment and the transfer of latest technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to domestic acts and UN resolutions, etc. the U.S. is enforcing the freeze of the DPRK's assets, bans on aid, financial transaction and assistance, loan contracts, search operations against suspicious ships in the open seas, confiscation of banned materials and control over all the exports and imports of materials related to all types of weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are more than hundreds of acts and measures of the U.S. for applying sanctions against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are slapping double and treble sanctions upon the DPRK through the \"Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-use Goods and Technologies,\" etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cite just an example, the U.S. prevented other countries from exporting raw Vanadium to the DPRK in 2009, on the plea that it might be used for missile production. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are thousands of materials and technologies on which embargo is put like this. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They enforce an embargo on equipment for chemical industry under the pretext that they may be diverted to dual-use and are controlling even the delivery of raw materials for cosmetics, claiming that they may be used for the production of chemical weapons. They are banning the export of long-bed vehicles to the DPRK by this or that way under the pretext that they may be used as carriers or launchers of missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, they block it, talking about \"dismantlement of nukes\" and \"transparency.\" They have become so mean as to claim rice should not be provided to the DPRK as it may be diverted to military use and it is advisable to provide only confectionery or nutrients that cannot be kept for a long time and even in that case they should be given little by little every month. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the Lee Myung Bak regime of south Korea is most zealous in executing the U.S. sanctions against the DPRK, the memorandum goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In July 2008 the Lee group of traitors unilaterally derailed the tour of Mt. Kumgang which had been conducted for nearly 10 years, driving the work in the Kaesong industrial zone to an extreme crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was more desperate in the moves to cook up UNSC resolutions on sanctions against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at present the Lee group is busy with diplomacy intended to implore other countries to refrain from investing, giving humanitarian aid and having any deal with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the Lee group are sadly mistaken if they think such mean sanctions would help shake the faith and will of the Korean people and break the single-minded unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither sanctions nor pressures can hold in check the dynamic advance of the DPRK along the road of independence, Songun and socialism."

            "content": "FDRP publica memorandum sobre sancion anti-RPDC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 20 de junio (ACNC) -- El Comite Central del Frente Democratico para la Reunificacion de la Patria (FDRP) hizo publico el dia 20 un memorandum para denunciar el caracter siniestro y sucio de la campana de sancion anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea que arman Estados Unidos y sus satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\tAbajo se transmite el texto resumido:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperialismo norteamericano provoco el 25 de junio de 1950 la guerra coreana y definio a Corea el 17 de diciembre del mismo ano como \"pais enemigo que amenaza la seguridad de EE.UU.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde entonces, comenzo a romper, en virtud del \"ley de comercio exterior con los paises enemigos\", todas las relaciones economicas con la RPDC, especificamente, la congelacion de propiedades y el cese del comercio, inversiones, transacciones financieras y mensajeria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la decada de 1960, segun la llamada \"ley de ayuda al extranjero\", prohibio totalmente los negocios con Corea tanto del nivel gubernamental como del empresarial y bancario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las decadas de 1970 y 1980, aplicando la \"ley de comercio\", \"ley de medidas de emergencia para la economia exterior\", \"ley del banco de exportacion e importacion\" y otras, amplio el perimetro de la sancion contra la RPDC en el comercio exterior, la inversion, el seguro, el credito, el prestamo, el alquiler y las demas esferas economicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 20 de enero de 1988, al incluir absurdamente a la RPDC en la lista de los \"paises que patrocinan el terrorismo\", activo contra ella todos los codigos de sancion, inclusive \"ley de administracion de exportacion\", \"ley de ayuda al extranjero\", \"ley de control de exportacion de armas\" y \"ley de instituciones financieras internacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuspendio finalmente la construccion de la central de reactores de agua ligera, que debe suministrar a la RPDC segun el Acuerdo Basico RPDC-EE.UU. firmado en Ginebra en octubre de 1994, lo cual causo enormes perdidas a la industria coreana de energia nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio y sus seguidores fabricaron en 2006 y 2009 en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU las resoluciones no.1718 y no.1874 para sancionar a la RPDC en la palestra internacional acusandola de prueba nuclear realizada para la autodefensa y de lanzamiento de satelite artificial con fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl volver a cuestionar en abril del ano en curso el lanzamiento de satelite artificial \"Kwangmyongsong no.3\" de la RPDC, ellos instigaron a publicar en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU la declaracion presidencial de \"condena\" y abogaron por las medidas adicionales de sancion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sancion no ataca solamente el sector militar de la RPDC sino casi todas las esferas civiles como los materiales necesarios a la vida del pueblo, los equipos y tecnologias de punta para las fabricas importantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves de la fabricacion de la ley nacional y la resolucion de la ONU, EE.UU. toma las medidas punitivas tales como la congelacion de propiedades de la RPDC, la suspension de la ayuda, el negocio y la asistencia financieros, la prohibicion de contratos de prestamo, el registro de barcos coreanos sospechosos en alta mar, la confiscacion de los materiales prohibidos y el control de importacion y exportacion de todas las armas y los materiales relacionados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlegan a cientos las leyes de sancion y las medidas de igual indole que el imperio aplica a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las fuerzas satelites aplican la sancion doble y triple a la RPDC segun el \"Acuerdo de Wassenaar sobre el control de la exportacion de armas convencionales, mercancias y tecnologias de doble uso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ejemplo, en 2009, EE.UU. ejercio presion sobre un pais para que no exporte a la RPDC el vanadio diciendo que esto puede usarse en la produccion de misiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora las materias y las tecnologias prohibidas por EE.UU. alcanzan a miles de generos, a saber, los equipos de industria quimica, las materias primas de cosmeticos, los camiones de caja larga. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAduce que esos materiales pueden tener doble uso como la fabricacion de armas quimicas y el transporte o el lanzamiento de misiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCondicionando la ayuda humanitaria con la \"renuncia nuclear\" y la \"transparencia\", insiste en suministrar cada mes a la RPDC poca cantidad de meriendas y productos nutritivos para que no puedan usarse como alimentos de los militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda del traidor surcoreano Lee Myung Bak se incorpora mas que nadie a la campana de sancion de EE.UU. contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa horda de Lee frustro unilateralmente en julio de 2008 el turismo al monte Kumgang que se realizaba durante casi 10 anos y llevo a la peor crisis la gestion de la zona industrial de Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActuo freneticamente en el CS de la ONU para fabricar la resolucion de sancion anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIncurre en todas las maniobras sucias para que otros paises no inviertan en la RPDC ni la ayuden como gesto humanitario ni negocien con ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstarian muy equivocados si EE.UU. y la banda titere surcoreana piensan que podrian quebrar la fe, la voluntad y la unidad monolitica del pueblo coreano con la campana de sancion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNinguna campana de sancion o presion podra impedir los pasos firmes de la RPDC que avanza por el camino de la independencia, el Songun y el socialismo."
