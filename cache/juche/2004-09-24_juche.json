Korea Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- The struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is a just and patriotic struggle to ensure peace of the country and accomplish the cause of national reunification by the efforts of the nation itself, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed article.\r\n Had it not been for the U.S. armed occupation of south Korea, the Korean nation would have built a reunified power in this land long ago and made a progress, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea, the Korean nation already suffered the scourge of a war and is exposed to the threat of another war today. The U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea and their moves to invade the DPRK have jeopardized the peace of the country and the security of the nation and thrown ordeals and barriers in the way of the cause of Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression forces should be driven out of south Korea as they are harassing peace on the Korean peninsula and putting a major stumbling block in the way of its reunification. Only then can the security of the peninsula be ensured and a peaceful atmosphere be created for its reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the exercise of its legal right by the Korean nation to demand the withdrawal of the U.S. aggression forces from south Korea. No one can take issue with this right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Keeping its forces in south Korea, the U.S. has violated the sovereignty of the Korean nation and it is still maintaining its forces in south Korea in disregard of the stipulation of the Korean Armistice Agreement calling for their withdrawal from south Korea and the resolution of the UN General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S is still riding high and mighty in disregard of international law to gratify its own aggressive interests, paying no heed to the interests of the Korean nation. Its occupation policy in south Korea can be scuttled only through a coordinated struggle of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the 70 million Koreans turn out they can certainly emerge the victor in the confrontation with the U.S. and greet a new era in national history in which they would become independent, reunified and prosperous, free from outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everyone who has the blood and soul of the Korean nation should fully discharge his or her responsibility and role in the patriotic struggle to make 2005 the year of the withdrawal of the U.S. force from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

When recalling that those computer games simulated actual wars, one cannot overlook such attempt to introduce north-targeted computer games into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean \"Wizard Soft\" should cancel at once its anti-national plan to distribute games inciting enmity towards the north in south Korea without any consideration, blind with money-making. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an anti-national, anti-reunification criminal act to introduce those controversial things aimed to provoke the north and incite anti-north feelings and conscience of confrontation in south Korea or overlook this practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war game of the U.S. imperialist warmongers can go over to a real war any moment. If the south Korean authorities permit the introduction of north-targeted computer games reflecting the U.S. sinister aim to invade the north, this will only prove their intention to incite confrontation with their fellow countrymen, start a war of aggression against the north in collusion with outside forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. stepped-up forward deployment of its troops with Japan as the most important base in Asia-Pacific is aimed to bring the DPRK under its control and contain big powers and thus establish its sphere of domination in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to invade the DPRK, a military and strategic vantage point, and put it under their control. It plans to use Japan as an advance base in hurling into the Korean peninsula task force from its mainland and other areas in case of its emergency. It is the U.S. plan to mobilize its naval and air forces and let its marines land on the peninsula in a coordinated operation with them and thus stage a land mobile warfare with its army involved. The U.S. intends to command the operations in an area close to the Korean peninsula, not in its mainland. In other words, it seeks to set up the U.S. air force command that has merged with the U.S. first army corps command in Japan and command the operation there. Herein lies the ulterior aim of the U.S. to use Japan as the most important vantage point of the U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. selection of Japan as the most important vantage point in implementing its Korean and Asian military strategy is designed to put into practice the long-range attack strategy calling for effectively wiping out enemies while suffering the least casualties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does so in the belief that Japan is its junior ally meekly obeying it as evidenced by Tokyo's active participation and cooperation in its war against terrorism. The Japanese people should clearly see through the dangerous nature of U.S. troops and their bases present in their country and vigorously struggle for their withdrawal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The white pine-nut tree grows only in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It bears nuts covered by white rinds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rind is thinner than that of other species. The nutmeat is 1.25 times and yield 1.5 times those of the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Researchers of the Institute of Forests of Economic Value under the Academy of Forestry and officials of the experiment station of oil-bearing trees have succeeded in spreading the tree by a method of budding saplings cultivated with white pine-nut seeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been known that pine-nut trees bear fruits 15 years after plantation. But the new species can yield after 6 to 7 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rinsan County has picked up pine-nuts from some years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Measures have been taken to propagate the tree quickly across the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: The revolutionary outlook on the leader is the ideological source of the revolutionary soldier spirit. The Korean People's Army (KPA), regarding the loyalty to its supreme commander as its lifeline, has demonstrated its invincible might in the fierce anti-imperialist struggle and on the forefront of the revolution and construction for over 70 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is stronger in ideology and faith as it has more transparent revolutionary outlook on the leader than any other ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA could, therefore, create the revolutionary soldier spirit in those hard days of the \"Arduous March\" and is now fully demonstrating its honor as the standard-bearer of the Songun revolution, a core unit and a main force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The staunch fighting spirit of the revolutionary forerunners is the ideological and mental basis of the revolutionary soldier spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners fought, considering President Kim Il Sung who taught them the revolutionary truth and led to the road of struggle as their spiritual mainstay and cherishing the firm faith that it is their honor to live or die on this road. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu served as an ideological and mental source that inspired the People's Army to fully display its might during the last Fatherland Liberation War and the death-defying confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the course of the struggle to successfully carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu created in the early period of the revolution, the Korean revolutionary armed forces have grown to be steel-strong ranks ready to staunchly fight in hearty response to any call of the Party and the leader without the slightest vacillation in any storm and stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main contents of the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu are the intense loyalty to Kim Il Sung, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, the spirit of overcoming any difficulties on one's own efforts, and the indomitable revolutionary spirit of wiping out enemies though they may often die. The revolutionary soldier spirit of the People's Army is displaying its invincible might as it is creditably carrying forward this spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
