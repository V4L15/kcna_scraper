Korea\r\n  Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet clique on September 5 staged a large-scale surprise river-crossing exercise simulating a northward invasion in the area of the south Han River, according to a radio report from Seoul.\r\n   The provocative rehearsal, which began with intensive firing by fighter bombers and cobra helicopters, reached the climax when a large number of army soldiers, tanks and armoured vehicles crossed the river through a mouth of the swift current and a floating bridge and helicopters dropped armed personnel and arms upon \"enemy's position\".\r\n   It ended with securing a bridgehead at the spot for attack. \r\n   It is one of this year's military drills which most undisguisedly revealed the south Korean puppets' ambition for northward invasion.\r\n   If they dare to unleash a war against the north, they will meet their end.    \r\n\r\n"

The \"Tsokai\" will be the third aegis ship deployed near the East Sea of Korea.\r\n   This fully shows that the Japanese reactionaries' wild ambition to invade the Korean Peninsula is invariable.    \r\n\r\n"

We cannot but take a serious view of this.\r\n   In June the Kim Young Sam regime purchased some 1,060 stinger missiles and 200 launching pads worth 307 million dollars from the United States allegedly to \"increase the defence capabilities to cope with surprise attack from the north.\"\r\n   Having alloted nearly 4,000 billion won or 15 percent increase over last year for military spending this year, the rRegime is importing sophisticated lethal weapons and mMilitary hardware even from Rrussia as well as the U.S. and other western countries.\r\n   This frantic arms import is aimed at unleashing war against the north in conspiracy with outside forces and finding a way out of the crisis.\r\n   No arms buildup and bellicose action will, however, give the puppets a way out.    \r\n\r\n"
