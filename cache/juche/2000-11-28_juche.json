Greatly satisfied to see the modern factory, with an annual production capacity of thousands of tons of starch, successfully built in such a short span of time, he advanced tasks to be carried out for operating the factory and transporting produced starch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he acquainted himself in detail with the farm's potato harvesting this year and put forward highly important tasks that would serve as a guideline in bringing about a radical turn in the potato farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expressing great satisfaction at the fact that the farm raised the yield of potato per hectare several times this year, he said that agricultural officials and workers should continue concentrating efforts on the potato farming so as to radically increase its output. And he indicated the detailed orientation and ways for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also learned in detail about the use of modern farm machines which have been greatly helpful to the potato farming and advanced tasks to turn this farm into a model farm where comprehensive mechanization is fully realized in a short period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he went to a pig farm newly built in the Paeksan branch of the integrated farm. Being briefed on its construction and the breeding conditions there, he highly appreciated the soldier-builders for having successfully built this modern stock-farm and set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the farm for its management and operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went to the newly built Taehongdan youth power station no. 4 to meet builders and praise their efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated the achievements made by the party members and other working people in the county this year and expressed the expectation and confidence that the integrated farm would bring about a new turn in agricultural production and rural construction to bring the superiority and vitality of the great socialist collective economic system into full play. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave on-site guidance  to the Phothae integrated farm in Samjiyon county on November 27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round a village of discharged soldiers at the Junghung branch, he expressed great satisfaction with the  key role played by them in potato farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He inspected the Phothae power station no.3 built by the farm on its own and set forth concrete tasks to realize electrification in the  mountainous areas as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said with great satisfaction that  officials and working people of the Phothae integrated farm have made new progress in carrying through the party's policy of making a revolution in potato farming and done a lot of work including the building of hundreds of modern houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by secretaries Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Yong Sun and first deputy department directors Pak Song Bong and Jang Song Thaek of the WPK Central Committee. \r\n\r\n"

Such acts can never be justified he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side's failure to take over the right to control the portions of the DMZ to be opened compelled the north side to settle the issue with the \"UN forces'\" side and this resulted in wasting a lot of time, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north-south military working-level talks could not open at the date on which both sides agreed and none of the agreements reached at the first round of the inter-Korean defence ministers' talks has been implemented properly. This is entirely due to the unjust stand and attitude of the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to militarily guarantee the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration which was agreed upon by the heads of the north and the south, it is necessary for both sides to refrain from undertaking any military action aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and settle the military issues related to the inter-Korean exchange and cooperation in good faith as agreed upon at the inter-Korean defence ministers' talks, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks both sides discussed specific technical issues of putting some portions of the DMZ through which railways and road will pass to relink the north and the south under the control of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides agreed to hold the second round of the north-south military working-level talks in the south side's portion of Panmunjom. \r\n\r\n"

This can be explained, first of all, by the fact that the harmony and great unity of the nation serve as a basic precondition for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking back on the history, the Korean nation has fallen victim to big powers' scramble for the expansion of the sphere of influence as it is surrounded by them. Therefore, to achieve national harmony and unity is of weighty significance in solving the problem of the nation independently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peaceful reunification of the country will be realized only when all the members of the nation achieve national harmony and great unity from the stand that every Korean belongs to the same nation, irrespective of ideology, political view and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reunification depends on the national harmony and great unity also because they are the essence of the issue of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essential for achieving the reunification of the country is not any procedure or method but the issue of attaining the true harmony and unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main issue in achieving national reunification will be solved when all the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas work together and achieve great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThen it is possible to solve other issues smoothly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the great unity of the Korean nation is most important for achieving national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no other way of achieving national harmony and reunification but federal formula under the situation where differing ideologies and systems exist in the north and south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans, who are concerned about the destiny of the nation, whether they are in the north, the south and overseas, should get united as one nation and pave together the way for national reunification. \r\n\r\n"

This is a serious lesson drawn from the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian and other peoples in the world should heighten vigilance against the U.S. and Japan's dangerous preparations for a biological and chemical warfare and foil them in order to defend the world peace. \r\n\r\n"
