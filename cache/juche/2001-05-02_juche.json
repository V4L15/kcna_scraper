Korean civilians flayed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- Sites where innocent civilians were massacred by GIs during the last Korean war were recently discovered and investigation into the truth behind the massacre and excavation are now underway in Pusan, South Korea.\r\n In this regard rodong sinmun today in  a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Pusan and south Kyongsang provincial society of bereaved families of civilians massacred during the June 25 Korean War\" carried out an excavation on April 8 to probe the truth behind the massacre in Pusan city, on the basis of a testimony made by an eyewitness, thus confirming the fact that more than 150 civilians were killed there. According to the testimony,  GIs and the police buried in secret the bodies of more than 150 civilians in Pusan prison jail-clothes after shooting them to death in September 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. imperialists are heinous ogres and the sworn enemy of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven by the newly disclosed GIs' mass killings of Koreans, the U.S. imperialist aggressors are most barbarous criminals who drenched the land of Korea with blood of its people and brought all sorts of misfortune, sufferings and disasters to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, anti-U.S. sentiment and voices strongly demanding the U.S. forces' pullout from South Korea are growing stronger than ever before among the South Koreans as they are keenly aware through their life experience that the U.S. forces in South Korea are neither \"peace force\" nor \"defender\" but the root cause of all evils there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not turn away from this reality. There is neither reason nor justification for the U.S. imperialist aggression troops  to stay in South Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to squarely see the reality and withdraw its forces from South Korea, not raising the issue of \"reduction of conventional forces\" of someone.    \r\n\r\n"
