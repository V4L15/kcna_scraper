Korean regime closes Namchongryon office\r\nPyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The \"civilian\" fascist clique of south Korea closed the office of the Kwangju-South Jolla Provincial Federation of University Student Councils (Namchongryon), according to a radio broadcast from Seoul.\r\n   Originally, Namchongryon, under the umbrella of the South Korean Federation of University Student Council (Hanchonryon) had its office at Chonnam National University, but it was closed by the regime two years ago. Later, the office was opened again at Chosun University.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime, in an effort to stifle the student movement, took some repressive steps at a \"meeting of security-related ministers\" on June 5. It issued an order to remove from universities public halls which have been used by \"Hanchongryon\" and ideological study circles of students. The closed office of Namchongryon was the first target of the order. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Statement of KCNA spokesman \r\n Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) issued a statement today accusing the Japanese right-wing reactionaries of conducting a vicious anti-DPRK campaign over the \"four-way talks\" and the \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl.\"\r\n   The statement says among other things:\r\n   The \"four-way talks\" is a matter which should be solved between the DPRK and the United States, parties concerned. \r\nIt is none of Japan's business. It is no use Japan's asking some other countries for \"help\" concerning this matter.\r\n   Japan is not a party to the \"four-way talks\" and is not entitled to talk about it.\r\n   Although some authorities and officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan call for \"cooperation\" and urge the DPRK to participate in the talks, this shows that Japanese diplomacy does not mind its p's and q's and that Japan without its own principle plays into the hands of the United States and the south Korean puppets.\r\n   Japan has so far approached the DPRK-Japan relations without political independence and its own views, reading others' faces.\r\n   Yielding to U.S. pressure and complaints of the south Korean puppets, the right-wing reactionaries of Japan raised the settlement of \"nuclear issue\" as a condition for normalization of DPRK-Japan diplomatic relations and thus brought the talks for normal ties with the DPRK to a rupture. Manipulated by the south Korean puppets, they are now raising the \"four-way talks\" as a condition for improvement of ties with the DPRK.\r\n   Their diplomatic attitude and political ignorance have foiled the efforts of some far-sighted politicians of Japan to make a breakthrough in the improvement of DPRK-Japan ties and are doing harm to the national interests and political future of Japan.\r\n   If the present authorities of Japan dance to the tune of right-wing reactionaries again from a narrow-minded and short-sighted attitude, Japan will be isolated and rejected by neighbouring countries first and will not be able to shake off the ill fame as the most abominable nation in the international political relations, far from exercising \"influence\" in the international community.\r\n   As for the allegation that the DPRK is suspected of having kidnapped a Japanese girl, we have already warned that it is a sinister political plot of the south Korean puppets to incite extreme anti-DPRK feelings and part of the joint anti-DPRK smear campaign of the right-wing reactionaries of Japan with the puppets within the framework of their absolutely pro-south Korean policy.\r\n   The \"suspicion\" is said to be based on \"unofficial information\" given by the South Korean puppet Agency for National Security Planning to the security authorities of Japan. This shows what the \"case\" is like and what lurks behind it.\r\n   Japan is one of south Korean agents' theatres of operation. They have kidnapped not only south Korean opposition figures but overseas compatriots there in broad daylight. If girls really disappeared in Japan and there have been no other testimony for their missing but that offered by south Korea's \"Agency for National Security Planning\", their whereabouts and the purpose of their \"abduction\" are only too clear.\r\n   If Japanese politicians have sound judgement, they should have already had a correct understanding of the \"incidents\".\r\n   But the reactionary rightists of Japan, availing themselves of the south Korean puppets' plot, have zealously fostered anti-DPRK feelings among the Japanese people, linking the \"incidents\" with the DPRK in a far-fetched way.\r\n   Obvious is what they are seeking through the \"incidents\".\r\n   They intend to hurt the image of the DPRK in the international community, fan up antagonism against the DPRK among the Japanese people and, in this way, flee from  the political, moral and historical responsibility for the immeasurable sufferings and losses Japan imposed on our people, for which it has still failed to compensate.\r\n   Japan's apology and compensation to the Korean and other Asian people are an unavoidable historical responsibility and national obligation in view of international law and usage and also in view of ethics and morality.\r\n   Over the past 50 odd years since the end of World War II, however, Japan has refused to atone for the crimes and avoid even its national responsibility for such horrible crime as \"comfort women\" issue, repeating such empty talk as \"regret\" and \"repentence\".\r\n   It is very natural that Japan is hated by the international community as \"dirty country\" and \"incredible country\".\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are loudmouthed about the \"suspected kidnapping of a girl\" in an apparent bid to evade worldwide condemnation and Japan's moral responsibility for the settlement of the past in such a way as abusing the DPRK. But it is only revealing their moral vulgarity fully.\r\n   Our people have a legitimate right to get an apology and compensation from Japan. Japan's full apology and compensation to the Korean people are also a strong demand of the international community.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries escalate the anti-DPRK smear campaign and continue trying to avoid the settlement of the past, with outcries over the fictitious, groundless \"incident\", the consequences will be irrevocable.\r\n   Our people will never tolerate their anti-DPRK acts and keep tabs on them through generations. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
