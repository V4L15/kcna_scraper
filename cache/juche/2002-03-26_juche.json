He was greatly satisfied to see the performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The orchestra with a long history encouraged the Soviet army and people with revolutionary and militant music pieces to achieve victory in the patriotic war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The orchestra is highly proud of participating in the concert given on the Red Square where a military parade was held to celebrate the victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chorus of \"the Kremlin, Moscow\" museum is recognized as one of the best art organizations in Russia. Its main mission is to ensure state functions together with the presidential orchestra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the Russian artistes are many artistes well-known to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Colonel P. B. Obshankov, composer of the presidential orchestra of the Russian Federation, is its chief conductor and People's Actor of Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russian Merited Actress l. Rudakova, singer of the State Academy Grand Theatre, is a world famous singer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She was highly praised by Kim Jong Il for her successful presentation given for him last year. \r\n Among the art envoys of the Kremlin are many talented actors and actresses and artistes of world fame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When interviewed at the airport, lieutenant general Sergei Streigin, head of the orchestra and commander of the garrison of the Kremlin, said that they came to Pyongyang carrying with them the deep respect of the Russian President for Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe orchestra would present the same numbers as were performed for Kim Jong Il in Moscow last year, he added.    \r\n\r\n"

The official told him that financial situation was so difficult that it would be involved in an extraordinary plan of foreign currency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time a large amount of money was needed to catapult the economy which was devastated during the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president earnestly told the official that money should be continuously sent to Koreans toiling in an alien land for education of their children even though one or two factories were not built. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A new item \"educational aid fund and stipends for sons and daughters of Korean residents in Japan\" has since been put in the state budget. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day in October Juche 52 (1963) a woman came to a unit of the people's army where her daughter was serving. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon hearing this news, the president called the girl soldier and told her that her mother came to see her in military uniform and they might look round the city next day and that he would take a lunch with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his loving care she went on a trip to her hometown according to an itinerary made by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about his noble personality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early in February Juche 45 (1956) he went to a mine. He first dropped in at a nursery of the mine and learned about the actual condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not long after the end of the war, so that hygienic and cultural conditions of the nursery were not so good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He admonished the officials not to boast of the mine's big prospect only but to value children who would shoulder the future of the mine. He instructed the officials to change the newly built office rooms of the party committee into the nursery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the bright and vast office rooms were turned into a nursery.     \r\n\r\n"

And a U.S. \"nuclear posture review\" was disclosed before the ongoing largest U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises were launched. The facts go to prove that the DPRK is a main target of the U.S. imperialists' \"anti-terrorism\" strategy, an aggressive world strategy, and war hysteria of the hawkish Bush group seeking to stifle the DPRK by force of arms has reached an extremity, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers are seeking to browbeat the DPRK, posing a threat of nuclear attack and kicking up a war racket. But it will only heighten the Korean army and people's spirit of national independence and harden their will to annihilate the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people respect Kim Jong Il, the peerlessly brilliant commander, as the great leader and supreme commander. \r\n Our revolutionary armed forces, once an order is issued in the event of emergency, will reduce all the aggressors to forlorn wandering spirits with the mobilization of all their potentials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, where all the people have been armed and every part of which has been turned into an impregnable fortress, has nothing to fear and will remain impervious to any attack of aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people regard the U.S. imperialist warmongers' frantic military maneuvers as nothing but a military game staged by those who look like a puppy knowing no fear of the tiger. But they strongly assert that the DPRK should demonstrate its military might to those war hawks and settle accounts with them this time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their hearts are burning with anti-U.S. sentiment and revengeful thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hawkish Bush group should renounce its arbitrary practices and wild dream for hegemony and drop its anti-DPRK hardline policy, if it is concerned about the destiny and future of the United States.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
