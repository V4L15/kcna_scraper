            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Accused of Disturbing Businessmen' Work to Adjust Properties\r\n Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Guidance Bureau of the Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Tuesday as regards the negotiations for the adjustment of real estate of the south side in Mt. Kumgang resort:\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK recently took measures to let those concerned of the south side enter Mt. Kumgang resort to discuss the issue of adjusting real estates there and do business and property registration again and either take part in the international tour at their will or dispose of their properties by way of lease, transfer and sale according to a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK on setting up the special zone for international tour of Mt. Kumgang and the DPRK law on special zone for international tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was prompted by the purport to resume the tour at an early date and show the nation's famous mountain to an increasing number of people at home and abroad and meet the interests of the south side's businesses under the situation where the suspension of the tour drags on due to the unjust behavior of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south authorities, however, approached the measures taken by the DPRK with insincerity. They deliberately blocked the south side's businessmen from entering Mt. Kumgang resort for the adjustment of their properties. In face of the DPRK's criticism and protest by businesses, the authorities brought with them only a few businesses out of more than 30 businesses holding real estate in Mt. Kumgang resort. And they, insisting on authorities' negotiations only, prevented the businesses from meeting those from the north side and did not allow them to speak out at the negotiating table.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were two attempted negotiations for the adjustment of the properties in Mt. Kumgang resort but the north side could not have an opportunity to properly talk to NGO businessmen of south side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking into consideration the embarrassing position of the south side's businesses suffering undeserved damage due to the authorities' arbitrary practices, the north side decided to finally clinch the above-said issue by giving them more time till July 29.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, far from feeling responsibility for it, stuck to their unreasonable stand, talking about \"retract of the law on special zone\", \"breach of south-north agreement\" and \"infringement upon property right\". They even proposed authorities' working talks, revealing their attempt to elbow out NGO businesses and have the negotiations for the adjustment of properties and those for the tour to themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, they talked about \"sticking to the existing stand\" on the issue of resuming the south Koreans' tour, an issue drawing attention of domestic and foreign public, thereby betraying their ulterior design to build a higher barrier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK declared the area for tour of Mt. Kumgang as a special zone for international tour and enacted a special law according to it. This was a legitimate measure taken to cope with the south Korean authorities' unilateral suspension of the tour for three years under an absurd pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for \"breach of agreement\" and \"infringement upon the right to properties\", it was none other than the south side which breached and scrapped the agreement reached between Hyundai and the DPRK and it was again the south Korean authorities who caused the DPRK and the south side's businesses such big losses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK and Hyundai made the tour of Mt. Kumgang successful, by cooperating with each other. But the south Korean authorities unilaterally suspended it without any consultation with the parties concerned and have so far stood in the way of resuming it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the case of a tourist which the south Korean authorities put up as a pretext for suspending the tour is concerned, the south side was entirely to blame for the case as it was an incident that took place because the south side failed to put its personnel under proper control and thus the tourist illegally trespassed on the area under the military control of the north side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side also failed to pay a large portion of money it owed to the north side for the tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no room to talk about the north-south agreement at present and it has already become a dead paper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation the DPRK invested the Hyundai with the right to do south Koreans' tour under the new law on the special zone and offered the south side's businesses the opportunity to hold negotiations for the protection of their properties. This was the biggest favor shown by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the DPRK's sovereignty is exercised over the special zone for international tour of Mt. Kumgang. So, the adjustment of properties in this area can be done under the DPRK's law and it does not require any discussion with the south side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, behaved arrogantly and disturbed the work to adjust the properties, reminding one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" An aim sought by them is to torpedo the international tour and block the resumption of the south Koreans' tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This petty trick will no longer work on anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should allow the entry of the south side's businesses holding their properties in Mt. Kumgang resort by July 29 so that they may do business and property registration and decide to take part in the international tour or lease, transfer or sell their properties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On this premise, the DPRK will consider authorities' working talks proposed by the south side authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is ready for both international tour and resumption of the south Koreans' tour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities try to use the working talks between authorities, defying the just demand of the DPRK and elbowing out NGO businessmen, as a lever for disturbing the implementation of the above-said law and the adjustment of the properties of the south side's businesses, the DPRK will not accept the authorities' working talks but take strong legal measures to dispose of the south side's properties as it had already declared."

He has led the Korean army and people in the struggle against the U.S.-led imperialists, starting his Songun revolutionary leadership at the beginning of the 1960s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forward the KPA as the core unit and the main force of the revolution and established the Songun politics as the basic mode of politics under socialism, thus providing a powerful weapon for the struggle to defend the country and confront with the U.S.-led imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has displayed its dignity as an invincible politico-ideological power and world-leading military giant, winning victories one after another in the showdown with the imperialist allied forces. With this strong military guarantee, the Korean army and people have worked world-startling miracles and feats in the drive to build a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The credit for all those successes goes to Kim Jong Il, legendary Songun brilliant commander and peerlessly patriot who has been held in high esteem as the top leader of the party, the army and the state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter urged all the servicepersons and people to resolutely smash the vicious and reckless anti-DPRK confrontational moves of the U.S. imperialists and the Lee Myung Bak group and bring about a decisive turn in building a thriving socialist country and accomplishing the cause of national reunification under the Songun leadership of the great Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A touch-and-go situation is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula due to the heinous political and military provocations committed by the south Korean group of traitors and its military hooligans under the patronage of the U.S., he noted, saying:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors has got hell-bent on the confrontation with the DPRK in disregard of the DPRK's sincere efforts for peace and reunification. It is committing in succession such never-to-be-condoned treacherous and anti-reunification actions as persistently insulting the dignity of the DPRK's leadership and slandering its system and the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have regarded the reckless moves of the group adding to the hideous crimes against the nation as a declaration of a new war. With arms of justice for retaliation they will wipe out the group of traitors without parallel from this land and surely accomplish the historic cause of national reunification at an earlier date."

The work also clarifies that it is hard to properly understand the quintessence of the Juche philosophy, if it is explained within the framework of the preceding philosophy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The clarification that the Juche philosophy is an original one quite different from the preceding philosophy provided an ideological and theoretical weapon for conducting study of the Juche philosophy and explaining it strictly in line with the idea of the Workers' Party of Korea, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche philosophy clarifies in a unique manner that man is the only social being and man has intrinsic characteristics--independence, creativeness and consciousness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The overall establishment of Juche-oriented understanding of man thanks to the Juche philosophy helped put an end to the wrong view that the intrinsic nature of man is an extension of his natural and biological attribute and its development and perfection, firmly preserve the purity of the Juche philosophy and lay a solid ideological foundation of Korea-style socialism centered on the popular masses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korean-style socialism could win victory after victory by displaying its advantages even under the complicated world political situation because the WPK has resolutely defended socialism by retaining a firm grip on the Juche philosophy centered on man, on the popular masses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Juche philosophy is a revolutionary doctrine that correctly reflected wishes and desire of the popular masses and generalized and formulated a wealth of experience gained under the leadership of the party and the leader. For this reason, the Juche philosophy serves as a popular one which everybody can easily understand and accept in the struggle as a weapon and encyclopedia giving answers to all questions arising in revolution and construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everything the WPK conceives and designs stems from the most correct view and stand toward the popular masses, the article concludes."

It is not the first time either for them to apply double standards in judging China combating divisive moves and violent and terrorist activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the historical point of view, the United States and other Western nations have often played a disgraceful role in such activities in other countries, developing nations in particular. Taking Tibet as an example, Britain began openly stretching out its claws of aggression to Tibet in the late 19th century. Failing in two invasions, it instigated separatists to claim \"independence of Tibet\", trying several times to attain its goal to divide China in international arenas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the end of the Second World War, the United States began interfering in the Tibet region. It was directly involved in a rebellion in Tibet, attempted to help the Dalai Lama escape from the region and disturbed the situation of the border area through assaults. It also supported the Dalai Lama group to conduct protracted divisive activities in the international community. It is still refusing to take its hands off Tibet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years, the West's moves for Chinese division are not confined to Tibet only. The West supported the separatists in Xingjiang by all means and even incited violence and terrorism there. Western forces were behind all terrorist acts committed in Xinjiang in recent years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We must be clearly aware of it and discard a naive dream that the West would support China in anti-terrorist battle. We must defend unity and solidarity and categorically reject the West's persistent interference in Chinese affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world has many lessons we must learn. The U.S. chooses its allies for the sake of its interests, leaves no stone unturned for destruction and disturbance, cause unrests in other nations and regions and even interfere in their affairs by force of arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a nation favors the West, it is termed a champion of freedom, democracy and human rights, enjoying support from the West. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a nation opposes the West, it is branded as dictatorial and cruel state and terrorist organization, becoming a target of the West's attack. This is just the far-fetched logic proper to the Western nations, particularly the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The logic makes it difficult to identify who supports terrorism and violence. In fact, many countries were put to shame due to Western countries' double standards and misinformation. China also suffered a heavy loss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the anti-terrorism issue, China will join in international cooperation but will oppose slandering and groundlessly blaming others for one's own purpose. It will never allow others to interfere in its internal affairs under this or that pretext."

Y propusieron las conversaciones de trabajo de autoridades con el intento de arrogarse el derecho a las negociaciones para el arreglo de bienes y el turismo, excluyendo a las empresas civiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ademas, en cuanto a la reanudacion del turismo por la parte Sur, tema que centra la atencion de la opinion publica interna y externa, pretenden obstaculizarla de la peor forma hablando del \"mantenimiento de la posicion establecida\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hemos declarado la zona turistica al monte Kumgang como la zona especial de turismo internacional e instituido la nueva ley especial al respecto. Esta medida apegada a la ley corresponde al hecho de que las autoridades surcoreanas suspendieron unilateralmente durante 3 anos el turismo al monte Kumgang bajo pretextos injustos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En cuanto a la supuesta \"violacion del acuerdo\" y la \"violacion del derechos sobre propiedades\", las mismas autoridades surcoreanas violaron y rompieron el acuerdo entre Hyundai y la RPDC y causaron tremendos danos a esta y empresas surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ellas interrumpieron unilateralmente el turismo al monte Kungang, que marchaba bien entre la RPDC y Hyundai, sin ninguna consulta con los firmantes del acuerdo e impiden hasta hoy su reanudacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El incidente de la turista surcoreana, pretexto usado por las autoridades surcoreanas, es una desgracia ocurrida debido a la intrusion ilegal en la zona de control militar de la RPDC causada por la falta de control de turistas y la responsabilidad recae enteramente sobre la parte surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La parte surena no ha pagado mucho dinero que debe a la RPDC por concepto de turismo al monte Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ya no vale la pena hablar del acuerdo Norte-Sur convertido en letra muerta hace mucho tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aun bajo estas circunstancias, hemos hecho el gran favor de seguir concediendo a Hyundai el derecho de turismo de la parte surena en virtud de la nueva ley de la zona especial y dar la oportunidad de negociar para la proteccion del derecho sobre propiedades de las empresas surcoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t De hecho, el ajuste de los bienes en la zona especial del turismo internacional al monte Kumgang se puede realizar segun la ley de la RPDC y no hace falta discutirlo con la parte surena, porque la zona esta bajo la jurisdiccion de nuestra parte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A pesar de esto, las autoridades surcoreanas lo obstaculizan partiendo de su intento de frustrar el turismo internacional e impedir la reanudacion del turismo patrocinado por la parte surena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, esa astucia es insuficiente para enganar a la gente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades surcoreanas deben enviar a los representantes de empresas surcoreanas que tienen bienes en el monte Kumgang hasta el 29 de julio, definido por nuestra parte como fecha limite, para que ellos puedan registrar de nuevo sus negocios y bienes, participar en el turismo internacional o alquilar, traspasar y vender sus propiedades, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A tales condiciones, tomaremos en consideracion las conversaciones de trabajo de las autoridades Norte-Sur presentadas por el segundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estamos preparados tanto para el turismo internacional como para la reanudacion del turismo auspiciado por la parte surena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si las autoridades surcoreanas intentan utilizar las conversaciones de trabajo entre las autoridades como el espacio para obstaculizar la ejecucion de la ley de la zona especial y el ajuste de bienes rehusando la justa demanda de la RPDC y excluyendo las empresas civiles surcoreanas, no las aceptaremos y pasaremos resueltamente a la disposicion legal de los bienes de la parte surena como hemos declarado ya."
