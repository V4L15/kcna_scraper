Such hostile elements like Kerry would not like to see them though all other people in the world will be able to understand them in the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kerry's malignant invectives against the social system in the DPRK are no more than a manifestation of his frustration and outbursts let loose by the defeated as the DPRK is winning one victory after another despite the whole gamut of pressure upon it over the nuclear issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before blaming others, Kerry had better ponder over what to say of the U.S., tundra of human rights, as it commits horrible genocide in various parts of the world in disregard of international law under the signboard of \"liberty\" and \"democracy\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said reports do not deserve even a passing note as they are peppered with all lies and hypocrisy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what a wicked hypocrite he is, he should bear in mind that no pressure is workable on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No problem can be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. as long as the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK will keep going its own way."
