Paektu, the holy mountain of the Korean nation, it was necessary to thoroughly implement the agreement already reached at the general-level military talks, which also calls for dismantling the propaganda means before the talks, and thus creditably fulfill their responsibility and mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBoth sides discussed the issue of commencing the 3rd stage-work to remove propaganda means in the areas from the central sector of the front to the eastern sector of the front on July 25 and completing it by Aug. 13, the issue of taking a series of measures to prevent clashes in the West Sea, the issue of holding military working talks to wind up the removal of propaganda means and review it in the portion of the north side in Panmunjom at around mid-August and procedural matters concerning the third round of the general-level military talks, etc. They reached an agreement on the relevant issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has paved the way for completely removing all kinds of propaganda means from the areas along the Military Demarcation Line, which have existed for more than half a century, before the significant 60th anniversary of Korea's liberation.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

After occupying Korea by force of arms, the Japanese imperialists worked hard to stamp out the national character of the Korean people and changed the names of the territory of Korea, its seas and local areas into Japanese as they pleased, even driving iron piles in its famous mountains, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing the Japanese reactionaries of further speeding up the preparations to go nuclear, become a military giant and launch overseas aggression, far from admitting the thrice-cursed crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in the past and duly apologizing and compensating for them, they said these reactionaries are getting frantic in their moves to grab Tok Islet, an inalienable part of the territory of Korea, and busy distorting and negating their crime-woven history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are paying tribute to the top war criminals, persistently insisting on visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine,\" the object of the Asian people's curse. Even after the adoption of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration they are escalating the offensive to pressurize the DPRK politically, diplomatically, economically and militarily, pulling up the DPRK over the \"nuclear issue\" and bringing forward even the \"abduction issue\" which had already been resolved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate efforts can the Japanese militarist forces cover up their crime-woven past. The Korean people will take a thousand-fold revenge upon the Japanese reactionaries, their sworn enemy keen to repeat their crime-woven history, and give vent to their pent-up resentment against them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This chilled the atmosphere of the talks and deliberately threw hurdles in the way of discussing their agenda items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will find nothing to do at the future six-party talks even if it attends them unless it drops its crooked viewpoint and way of thinking. Its participation would only create more complexities to the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The negative role played by Japan at the previous rounds of the talks compels the DPRK not to deal with Japan even if the talks are resumed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The invariable attitude of Japan towards the multi-party talks only increases disillusionment with it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Attending it were former officials of the U.S. administration, members of both houses of the U.S. Congress, politicians of south Korea and dozens of reactionary non-governmental organizations in the U.S. and south Korea. A seminar, exhibition, film show, etc. are also reportedly planned by it. \r\n To this end, the U.S. administration authorized the above-said organization to convene some meetings, pursuant to the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and allotted two million U.S. dollars to finance them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing new that the \"Freedom House\" again called the \"human rights meeting\" as it has been hell-bent on smear campaigns and wrongs against the DPRK as a waiting maid serving the U.S. in its execution of the \"human rights policy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But what should not be overlooked is that such kind of meeting gained in its scope and attendance and it was held in the run-up to the resumption of the six-party talks under the zealous patronage and support of the authorities unlike the preceding meeting when riffraff gathered to kick up an anti-DPRK row. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community pays attention to the six-party talks to be held in next week and wishes to see them to make positive progress through sincere and honest dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is getting more frantic in its anti-DPRK racket over the human rights issue, getting on the nerves of the dialogue partner as evidenced by the adoption of the \"resolution on abduction\" and the \"meeting on the north Korean human rights.\" This is a disturbing behavior incompatible with dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has neither justification nor face to tell the DPRK this or that over the human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical for the U.S. to talk about the human rights of someone as it does not hesitate to abduct the head of a sovereign state and overthrow the legitimate government of other country for the mere reason that it falls out of Washington's favor and stands in the way of meeting its interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about \"improved human rights\" and \"freedom\" of the DPRK is aimed to use the human rights issue as well as the nuclear issue as the two pillars of its policy to isolate and stifle the latter and realize its attempt to \"bring down the system\" of the latter under that pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. recourse to political provocations over the non-existent \"human rights issue\" out of its deep-rooted hostility and antagonism against the DPRK deprives it and the countries concerned of any optimism about substantial progress in the six-party talks.\r\n Such provocative acts as slandering and vilifying the dialogue partner make it impossible to orient the talks to a positive track and will drive them to conflict and rupture in the long run.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Afterwards, he gave on-the-spot guidance to the county several times with a plan to supply people with fruits in all seasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days he gave detailed instructions ranging from issues of mechanizing fruit-culture and introducing chemicals into it to those of manuring and cultivating fruit trees, and took steps to convert the county into a model in building orchards throughout the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inspired by his guidance, people of the county reclaimed mountains to plant fruit trees in a thousand hectares within a few years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing himself on the success and experience, the President convened an enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in Ryongjon-ri, Pukchong County, in April 1961. At the meeting he made a concluding speech calling for launching an all-people campaign to build orchards throughout the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In hearty response to his call, nature-harnessing projects were started in all parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As of 2002 the acreage of orchard in Ryongjon-ri increased to 147 hectares from 80 hectares in 1961. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pukchong County is now taking the lead in industrializing and modernizing the fruit production in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il, who visited the Munhwa Co-op Farm of Ryongjon-ri in June 2002, was very satisfied to see cozy dwelling houses at the foot of a mountain covered by various kinds of fruit trees.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "World Community Called Upon to Check Japan's Bid for Permanent Membership of UNSC\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 20 (KCNA) -- Japan has not yet won confidence of the international community for it has threatened global peace and security. Its bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council is aimed to become a political power and use it for holding hegemony in Asia and other parts of the world. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article.\r\n Japan set it as an ultimate goal of its diplomacy to sit on the U.N. Security Council this year which will mark the 60th anniversary of the world body and to this end, it has busied itself soliciting support from big countries and showing off its moneybags before developing countries to lure and bribe them, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's pitch for a permanent seat on the UNSC would prevent the world body from properly fulfilling its mission and achieving the purpose of its reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is still recorded as an \"enemy state\" in the UN Charter. Its bid for the seat is, therefore, prompted by its ambition to reinvade Asia and conquer the world. The world has already branded Japan as one of the most dangerous aggressor forces disturbing the present international peace order. The country is not entitled to talk about global peace.\r\n Japan should not be allowed to sit on the SC in order to ensure the efficiency of the world body, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's diplomacy is characterized by its blind submission and servitude towards the U.S. The country bereft of independence is accustomed to reading the U.S. face before clarifying its stand on any international issue. In case Japan, which acts at the beck and call of its American master without its own principle, is allowed to sit on the SC,  that will only mean one more vote for the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That may also entail such adverse consequences as impairing the authority of the U.N. Its prestige is bound to be damaged if permanent membership of the SC goes to Japan because Tokyo has failed to win confidence from its neighboring countries, to say nothing of the international community. Japan's wrong attitude and stand toward its past history of aggression have greatly enraged the Asian people. The ultra-right forces in Japan are desperately negating and justifying the aggression committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past.  Japan is the only war criminal state and a defeated nation that has not yet admitted its past crimes nor made any apology and compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is prompted by the childish way of thinking peculiar to Japan that money is everything no matter how severe contempt it may suffer from the international community. The pitch for a permanent seat on the SC on account of its contribution to the UN can not be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to damage the confidence of the international community in the U.N.  Japan would be well advised to honestly admit the crimes committed by it in the past, fully compensate for them and turn over a new leaf before impertinently eying a responsible post at the UN. This is an urgent task before Japan and the demand of the world. The world community should never allow Japan to take a seat on the UNSC unless it fulfills the above task.         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"
