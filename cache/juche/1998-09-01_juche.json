Korean authorities must not act imprudently\r\n  Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Korean Asia-Pacific Committee published a statement today as regards tours of Mt. Kumgang which are being stepped up within the framework of nongovernmental economic cooperation between the north and the south of Korea.\r\n   Pointing out that organised tours of Mt. Kumgang by ship were agreed on by the north and the Hyundai business group in South Korea and are being stepped up as a link in chains of nongovernmental economic cooperation, the spokesman said:\r\n   In connection with this, South Korean \"Prime Minister\" Kim Jong Pil alleged that annual tourist costs must be lowered below 100 million dollars and that the north must be pressurized not to use earnings from tourism for the purpose of the munitions industry.\r\n   \"Minister of National Unification\" Kang In Dok insisted on holding talks between authorities in order to discuss personal safety of tourists. Worse still, he compelled the Hyundai business group to fix fees of each tourist below 300 dollars.\r\n   The South Korean authorities have no face to poke their nose into the organised tours of Mt. Kumgang which have been stepped up by us and the Hyundai Group.\r\n   Taking into account the ardent desire of South Korean people, we have pushed ahead with tours of Mt. Kumgang for the purpose of achieving national reconciliation and unity through this undertaking.\r\n   However, the South Korean authorities have blocked all forms of economic cooperation between us and Hyundai Group.\r\n   Whenever an opportunity presented itself, they cried that they would promote nongovernmental economic cooperation with the north on the principle of \"separation of politics from economy.\"\r\n   Just as tours of Mt. Kumgang are  nongovernmental cooperation between the north and the south, there will be no problem if parties concerned reach an agreement. And the use of earnings and guarantee for personal safety  of tourists in our side are matters belonging to us.\r\n   The long and short of  behaviors of the South Korean authorities is that they seek to frustrate the tours of Mt. Kumgang. In other words, their deeds are nothing but a declaration that they would obstruct even nongovernmental cooperation.\r\n   We will follow the deeds of the South Korean rulers and make them pay dearly for all consequences. \r\n\r\n"

Then it may play into the hands of imperialists and dominationists as well.\r\n   The movement should strengthen its unity and solidarity in every way. Only then can it increase its potentials and carry out its tasks with credit.\r\n   It should strengthen the unity based on solidarity and cooperation, as well as collective common action, with correct strategy and confidence in its strength so as to bring democracy to the United Nations and the international community and replace the present old international order with a new one.\r\n   In the next century it should strengthen the unity based on independence on the principle of mutual  respect, non-interference, equality and mutual benefit in order to keep the imperialists from dividing and alienating it and play the role as the driving force for the building of an independent new world.\r\n   It also should push ahead with an active struggle against the imperialist's policy of strength, their arbitrariness and privilege, true to the idea and principle, and make strenuous efforts for establishment of a new international order based on justice, equality and fairness.\r\n   Just is its cause. \r\n\r\n"
