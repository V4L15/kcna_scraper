It extended absolute support to the Korean people in their just struggle to build a reunified prosperous Korea.     \r\n\r\n"

And he received two liters of blood and a lot of sap. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was thus completely recovered in two months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear reminder of the true picture of the DPRK where all the people have become a great harmonious family.     \r\n"
