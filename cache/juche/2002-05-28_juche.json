And he received two liters of blood and a lot of sap. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was thus completely recovered in two months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear reminder of the true picture of the DPRK where all the people have become a great harmonious family.     \r\n"

            "content": "CPRF spokesman denounces Ri Hoe Chang's remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland today issued a statement denouncing Ri Hoe Chang of South Korea for negating the second point of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n The second point of the joint declaration in which the north and the south, recognizing the commonness of their reunification proposals, agreed to work for reunification in this direction indicates the most fair and aboveboard way of ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula and co-existence and co-prosperity of the nation and achieving its reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Hoe Chang's negation of the second point of the joint declaration goes to clearly prove that he is opposed to exchange and cooperation between the north and the south as well as to their co-existence and does not want a peaceful solution to the issue of reunification, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Negating the second point of the joint declaration means opposing exchange and cooperation between the north and the south and their co-existence and, in the long run, saying no to the joint declaration itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As he admitted himself, Ri Hoe Chang has no alternative proposal concerning ways of reunification. If he has any, it is nothing but \"unification under liberal democracy,\" a leftover of the cold war era, and it is little short of a declaration of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By undisguisedly voicing opposition to the joint declaration, he openly declared that he would block the reconciliation and unity between the north and the south, their co-prosperity and peaceful development and take the road of war on all accounts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The CPRF resolutely denounces his remarks in the name of all the fellow countrymen, branding them as an unpardonable treacherous act of ditching the joint declaration and bringing disasters of a nuclear war to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that if such a guy as Ri Hoe Chang comes to power, the inter-Korean relations will be brought back to the state of confrontation in the cold war era and a war break out on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All parties, groups, personages and people from all walks of life in South Korea should wage a more vigorous struggle to dislodge and totally eliminate such wicked traitor and special-class anti-reunification element as Ri Hoe Chang, the statement concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
