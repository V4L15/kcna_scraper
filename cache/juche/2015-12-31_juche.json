            "content": "Name of DPRK Sounds Great: Russian Paper\r\n Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- An article titled \"The name of the DPRK sounds great\" contributed by commentator and writer Rabrentsi Gurzhiyev of the Russian newspaper Zabtra was posted on the website of the newspaper Tribuna on Dec. 17. \n\t\t\t\t\t The article quoted Marshal Kim Jong Un as saying when giving field guidance to the Phyongchon Revolutionary Site that the DPRK has turned into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to firmly defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK fought against the U.S.-led aggressors and stooges of 16 countries during the 1950 Korean war though it was very short of weaponry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It existed in the de facto political and economic vacuum in the 1990s when the world socialist system collapsed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It not only overcame difficulties but courageously mounted successive attacks on the formidable enemies, stepping up economic development while promoting science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being much upset by its offensives, the West was perturbed by the source of such tremendous strength of the DPRK which was hard pressed for everything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, however, had access to nuclear weapons for self-defence, regardless of what the West and pro-Western politicians claimed. The modern weaponry of the DPRK serves as a strong and reliable means for defending not only the Korean Peninsula but the border of the Far East and adding to the potential of the defense capability of Russia adjoining the coast of the Pacific."
