The brigandish U.S. imperialists and their allies' barbarous \"harshest sanctions\" to completely stifle the DPRK economically turned Juche Korea into a matchless great power based on the principle of independence, self-reliance and self-development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The U.S. imperialists' unprecedented moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK to stifle it militarily created the worst crisis in which it may make a retaliatory nuclear strike at the U.S. mainland any moment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The U.S. and its allies' moves to \"bring down the social system of the DPRK\" by splitting and destabilizing it are entailing the consequences of reducing the rotten and ailing capitalist system to dregs of history as it has lived out its days. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though all hues of hostile forces in the world come in attack on the DPRK with desperate efforts, they can never hold in check the dynamic advance of the great Paektusan nation along the Songun highway of sure victory under the leadership of the peerless Songun brilliant commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mankind will be pleased to see how the great Paektusan nation will remain shining as a beacon of independence and symbol of justice and truth."
