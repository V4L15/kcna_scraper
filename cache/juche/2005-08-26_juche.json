Harassed by a family affair, he went to Germany on January 6 and asked for refuge there. But his request was turned down and he was transferred to the Japanese embassy to return to his country.\r\n Seeking again for refuge, he left Japan on May 25 and arrived in JiAn City, Jilin Province, China. From there he swam across the River Amnok to reach Mitha-ri, Manpho City, Jagang Province of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been confirmed that he illegally entered the DPRK solely for his personal reason, not for any sinister political purpose.

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: The idea of \"By our nation itself\" gives full rein to the spirit of national independence which the Koreans regard as its life and soul and thus enables them to lay a solid groundwork for building an independent reunified powerful nation.\r\n National independence constitutes a basic principle which should be held fast to not only in the struggle for the cause of national reunification but in the whole course of hewing out the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" is mainly based on the spirit of national independence calling upon all the Koreans in the north and the south who are responsible for solving the issue to reunify the country not in reliance upon outside forces but by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea, by nature, never allows outsiders to interfere in settling the issue of the nation. The main problem in achieving the country's reunification will be settled and a groundwork be laid for building an independent unified state only when the Koreans embody the idea of \"By our nation itself\" which calls for settling all problems by the concerted efforts of the Koreans, guided by the idea, in line with the will and interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" gives fullest play to patriotism enshrined in the hearts of all the fellow countrymen to provide a powerful engine for building a reunified strong nation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
