This move of Japan has entered the phase of realizing the militarization of space, going beyond the tolerance limit, and taken the world by surprise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's military muscle has now become the second largest next to the U.S. in the capitalist world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists' adoption of the above-said law to pave the legal way for space militarization cannot be construed otherwise than a very dangerous move to wind up the preparations for carrying out the operation for military attack even in the field of space, keeping pace with their moves to bolster up their ground, naval and air forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is no longer a \"pacifist state\" but has emerged a dangerous force of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are making much ado about \"threat to Japan's security\" under the pretext of \"military threat\" from someone. This is, however, nothing but sophism intended to cover up the aggressive nature and danger of their criminal moves to turn Japan into a military giant and launch overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than Japan which is blatantly challenging peace by stepping up the preparations for reinvasion such as arms buildup under the eyes of the world after working out an ambitious military strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are working hard to evade the responsibility to redeem their crime-woven past, denying their past criminal aggression, prompted by their intention to justify their past aggression and embark upon the road of continental invasion again, concludes the article. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
