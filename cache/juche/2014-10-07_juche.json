If several weaponry systems are replaced after the year 2020 it is expected that the amount of fund will further swell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t New weapon-grade plutonium production base and nuclear test ground appeared in Los Alamos, etc. in New Mexico State and uranium enrichment started in a new installation in Tennessee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. which has a stockpile of nuclear weapons huge enough to devastate the whole earth is directing efforts to the modernization of the weapons, a serious encroachment upon the human right to existence and the world peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how noisily the U.S. may trumpet about a \"world without nuclear weapons\" it can never evade the responsibility as the arch criminal which poses a nuclear threat to the world by developing, manufacturing and deploying nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the world's biggest nuclear criminal state as it manufactured nuclear weapons and used them for the first time in the world and is now keen to dominate the world with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear policy sparked off the race for developing and manufacturing nuclear weapons in the world.
