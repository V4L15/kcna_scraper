It is, therefore, the cause of the nation which the Koreans are obliged to accomplish. That is why they should maintain an independent stand to solve all the issues arising in solving the country's reunification issue by their concerted efforts in their own interests according to their own decision without depending on others. Only then can they discharge their due responsibility and role as the master of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national reunification calls on all members of the nation to be aware of the spirit of national independence and categorically reject and oppose flunkeyism and the idea of depending on outsiders. The spirit of national independence serves as an ideological source for increasing the nation's might and bringing prosperity to it while flunkeyism and the idea of depending on outsiders are ideological poison rendering the nation mean-spirited and nerveless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The members of the nation forming the driving force for national reunification are from various classes and strata and have differing ideologies, political views and religious beliefs. But this would not be any obstacle to achieving great unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should make energetic endeavors to accomplish the cause of great national unity in order to strengthen the driving force for national reunification and increase its role with a strong resolution and will to reunify the country independently by their concerted efforts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

It is the iron will of Kim Jong Il that benevolent policy in socialist society is not contradictory to army and the benevolent policy presupposes a strong army.\r\n The circumstances and conditions of the revolution were unprecedentedly severe during the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march, but the faith and obligation of all the army and the people following the headquarters of the revolution were cemented and pure thanks to the Songun policy pursued by     Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will always devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution at the risk of their lives in glorious days or difficult days, keeping the benefit of the benevolent policy in their hearts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
