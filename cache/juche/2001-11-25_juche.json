This is evidenced by the dispatch of their advance fleet of warships and the announcement of a plan for the largest-ever U.S.-Japan military drill in waters around Japan. The 70 million Koreans are greatly angered by this. As a war criminal Japan has neither apologized nor compensated for its monstrous atrocities committed against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, it is keen on overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only shows the black-hearted design of the revived militarists to swallow up again the Korean peninsula first and then bring Asia under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves stepped up by Japan to become a military power after securing a legal foundation for the overseas dispatch of the \"SDF\" through the passage of the \"anti-terrorism special bill\" are posing a serious threat to the peace in the Asian region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The American Federation for Independence, Democracy and Reunification will solidarize with the 70 million Koreans and all the peace-loving forces of the world and wage a positive struggle against the revival of militarism in Japan and check its moves to realize overseas aggression and become a military power.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean \"minister of unification\" condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 25 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued its information bulletin no. 813 on Saturday denouncing the South Korean \"minister of unification\" for his remarks made as regards the deadlocked 6th inter-Korean ministerial talks.\r\n Much perplexed by the rupture of the talks, \"minister\" Hong Sun Yong, chief delegate of the south side to the talks appeared at a \"round-table conversation\" on Nov. 22 and told sheer lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior compels the north side to explain which side took a sincere attitude toward the talks and which side was insincere at the talks, the information bulletin said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side proposed practical measures to break the deadlock of the north-south talks. At the recent 6th ministerial talks, it made its every possible sincere effort to reach an agreement, taking the initiative of advancing a draft joint press release and giving the talks more days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the south side approached the talks without any preparation and failed to set out such draft joint press release from its calculation that no agreement would be reached between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the talks the chief delegate of the south side strained his every nerve only to justify the \"emergency alert\", arms buildup and military exercises staged against the north. And he was going to run away from the talks, with mere words that he would take note of the north side's reasonable charges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this stand, he self-righteously negated a joint press release agreed upon and worded by working officials of the two sides, which dealt with major points for the bilateral relations including the exchange of the fourth visiting groups of separated families and relatives to be held on Mt. Kumgang in December, and thus brought the ministerial talks to a rupture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hong Sun Yong should honestly apologize to the nation for the deadlocked authorities-to-authorities dialogue, with full responsibility for it.    \r\n \r\n"
