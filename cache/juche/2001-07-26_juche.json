Its loudmouthed \"threat\" from the DPRK is a cock-and-bull story fabricated to retain its military edge in the Asian region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the strategic aim of the U.S. imperialists' Asian policy to keep its troops in the region under the pretext of \"guaranteeing stability\" and retain their military edge there in a bid to contain other countries and go unchallenged in a war for interests and establish its political and military domination over the region.\r\n The U.S. call for putting emphasis on the Asian defence to \"cope with the threat\" from the DPRK means its intention to stay in the region under that pretext and retain its military edge there and thus continue aggression and interference in internal affairs of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is keen to launch another war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently it staged war exercises one after another after deploying new task forces and sophisticated military hardware in and around South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that the U.S. imperialists are the chief harasser of peace and stability in Asia.\r\n\r\n"
