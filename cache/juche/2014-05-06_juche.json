Such actions would destroy peace and stability of the peninsula and spoil the efforts for improved north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The purpose of the exercises is to round off the U.S. scenario for aggression on the DPRK, with \"occupation of Pyongyang\" as a main goal, under the simulated conditions of a real war. Involved in them are huge armed forces enough to conduct an overall war, as well as U.S. latest weaponry and means for a preemptive nuclear attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year the U.S. and south Korea staged the Ssangyong landing operational drill and the Max Thunder air battle drill as part of the largest-ever Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises, arousing serious concern among peoples at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such exercises are evidently a provocation to the DPRK and a direct threat aimed to wreck peace on the peninsula and the rest of the world and bring dark clouds of a nuclear war. So, it is quite natural and an exercise of legitimate rights for the DPRK to take self-defensive actions against the provocative moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. has described the DPRK's exercise of rights as \"provocation\" and \"threat\" in a bid to deceive the world community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, Marcel Cartier, an American who visited the DPRK as a tourist shortly ago, said jeering at this American-style gangster logic: \"Let's consider if the North Korean military was holding military drills annually off the coast of New York that simulated the occupation of the entirety of the country. Would it not be sensible given that context for Americans to develop a nuclear deterrent? The Koreans are not war hungry. However given the way that the situation in Libya played out, they are all the more convinced -- rightfully so -- that the only reason their independent state continues to stand is due to the Songun (military-first policy) and the existence of nuclear capabilities\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should be mindful that its impudent behavior will bring irrevocable and deadly disasters to itself. This is a stern warning given by the history for justice and peace."

However, Obama's behavior is little short of inviting misfortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now working hard to give a shot in the arm of Japan, an inferior ally, in a bid to realize its strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific. To this end, the former is zealously backing the latter in its moves to bolster up its forces and build legal and institutional mechanisms for waging a war such as Japan's exercise of the right to collective self-defense. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is a war criminal state which was severely punished by the international community for its crimes of aggression in the last century. It is also a dangerous country which has desperately watched for a chance to launch reinvasion since its defeat, far from thoroughly redeeming its crime-woven past with sincere efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that in case Japan is allowed to exercise the right to collective self-defense, something banned by the international order and its domestic law in the post-war period, this will be misused as a criminal lever for legalizing Japan's moves for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. makes no scruple of bringing disasters again to humankind by doing so in a bid to realize its wild ambition for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has only met repeated failures of its hostile policy toward the DPRK. However, it is now trying hard to realize its wild ambition to dominate Asia by using Japan as a shock brigade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the light of the wicked and ferocious nature of Japan, no one can vouch that such U.S. policy toward Japan would not prove counter-productive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past Japan used to stage its carefully arranged farces to demonstrate its close ties with the U.S., as evidenced by the Japan-U.S.  Peace Treaty, Treaty for Friendship and Trade and Katsura-Taft Treaty and others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But behind the scene, Japan bolstered up its economic and military muscle and did not hesitate to ignite a bloody war against its ally once a good chance came.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why Japan is censured worldwide as a country that cannot be trusted and the one reminiscent of \"Pandora's box\" in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asian countries are calling into question the past crimes perpetrated by Japan, keeping sharp vigilance over its militarist moves for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised not to forget the lesson taught by the Pearl Harbor incident in which it was hit hard on its head by Japan while conniving at and patronizing the Japanese imperialists' moves for military expansion and overseas aggression in the past."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Holds S. Korean Authorities Accountable for Ferry Sewol Tragedy\r\nPyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The ferry Sewol sinking in the waters off Jin Island, south Korea was not an accidental case but an inevitable product of the unpopular politics of the incompetent puppet authorities, says Rodong Sinmun on Tuesday in a commentary. \n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on: The disaster which claimed huge casualties was caused by the illegal practices of greedy ship owners utterly indifferent to the safety of passengers and elementary safety regulations and the present ruling forces of south Korea were chiefly to blame for the tragedy as they shut their eyes to them and connived at and patronized them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ferry sinking tragedy and what happened after it bring to light the irresponsible stand of the corrupt and incompetent Park Geun Hye group seeking only luxury and keen on maintaining power, not caring about the fate of the people, and shows a glimpse of the rotten and ailing south Korean society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park made much fuss, making a formal \"apology\" for the accident, passing the buck for it to some yesmen and firing them and visiting incense-mourning altars to \"console\" bereaved families of the dead. This was, however, nothing but crocodile tears intended to divert elsewhere the attention of the angry public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is absolutely intolerable is that the Park group invited U.S. President Obama to tour south Korea and incited confrontation with fellow countrymen in the north and kicked up hysteria for a war against it at a time when the whole of south Korea turned into a mourners' house due to the ferry Sewol tragedy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even Western media commented Park Geun Hye is not a human being, much less being a president.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can vouch that the second and third disaster more horrible than the Sewol tragedy will not occur as long as the Park group's unpopular rule goes on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is just waiting for its unfavorable situation to come to an end, taking a hands-off approach towards the Sewol tragedy. It is, however, seriously mistaken."
