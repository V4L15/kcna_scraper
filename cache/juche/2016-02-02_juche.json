However, there exists, in actuality, an attempt to bring down the social system in north Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. magazine National Interest on Jan. 20 asserted that the U.S. has to admit its negative policy on nuclear weapons which caused the DPRK to conduct four nuclear tests in the past decade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even forces in the U.S. mainland and its satellite countries are criticizing the present U.S. administration's north Korea policy, describing it as a completely failed one as it pushed the north to reinforcing its social system and having access to nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK had access to self-defensive nuclear war deterrence in order to cope with the U.S. nuclear blackmail getting undisguised as the days go by.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was entirely due to the U.S. anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK that it had access to nuclear weapons and the U.S.-DPRK relations have deteriorated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the U.S. ever more undisguised nuclear threat and blackmail there is high likelihood of outbreak of a nuclear war due to an accidental case in the Korean Peninsula where the Armistice Agreement had been nullified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK, the former's nuclear threat to the latter will persist and it will be left with no option but to take stronger measures one after another to bolster its nuclear deterrence both in quality and quantity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ruling quarters are entirely to blame for the situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to face up to the reality with cool head and make such a bold decision as rolling back its hostile policy towards the DPRK as early as possible."

Esta se vio obligada a poseer las armas nucleares para hacer frente a la amenaza de EE.UU., iniciada desde la decada de 1950.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlexandr Vorontsov, jefe de seccion de Corea y Mongolia del Instituto de Estudios del Oriente de la Academia de Ciencias de Rusia dijo que \"Corea del Norte (RPDC) nunca bombardeo a ningun pais ni intento el derrumbe del Poder de otros. Es muy absurda la sofisteria sobre la amenaza de este pais al mundo. Sin embargo, si existe realmente el intento de derrumbe del regimen contra Corea del Norte.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa revista norteamericana de relaciones internacionales National Interest insistio en su edicion del dia 20 de enero en que EE.UU. debe reconocer que su politica injusta sobre armas nucleares produjo las 4 pruebas nucleares de la RPDC efectuadas durante 10 anos pasados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo solo en EE.UU., sino en sus satelites, se escuchan las criticas severas de que la politica hostil anti-RPDC de la administracion norteamericana es \"la politica totalmente fracasada que empujo al Norte (RPDC) al fortalecimiento del sistema y la posesion de armas nucleares.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo muestran las opiniones publicas, EE.UU. es precisamente el autor que impulso la RPDC a la posesion de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl  disuasivo autodefensivo de guerra nuclear de la RPDC es, de rabo a cabo, para enfrentar con las amenazas cada vez mas abiertas del imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa posesion de armas nucleares de RPDC y el empeoramiento de relaciones RPDC-EE.UU. se deben a EE.UU. que ha venido practicando la anacronica politica hostil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActualmente, existe gran probabilidad de estallar la guerra nuclear por los elementos casuales en la Peninsula Coreana donde fue invalidado el Acuerdo de Armisticio debido a las amenazas nucleares de EE.UU. que se tornan mas abiertas dia por dia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras EE.UU. no abandona su politica hostil, se continuara la amenaza nuclear contra la RPDC y se seguiran tomandose las medidas mas intensas de esta para fortalecer de manera cualitativa y cuantitativa su disuasivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa capa dominante norteamericana tiene la responsabilidad total de la actual situacion creada en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe ver con seriedad la realidad y tomar de inmediato la decision de anular de manera radical la politica hostil contra la RPDC."
