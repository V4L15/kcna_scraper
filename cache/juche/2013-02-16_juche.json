It is nothing but a pretext for cracking down upon Chongryon as it is sophism misleading the public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon and all Koreans in Japan vehemently denounce the Japanese government for its unjust and high-handed action and strongly protest against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Intolerable is the behavior of Japan threatening the life of the Koreans in Japan and restricting the fair activities of Chongryon, a legitimate national organization of the compatriots in Japan, far from settling its past crimes and making reparation to the Koreans who were victims of Japan's colonial rule and forcibly taken away to Japan and their descendants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such additional \"sanctions\" will not only spark off denunciation and resistance of all Koreans in Japan and fair-minded Japanese people but seriously affect the efforts to improve the relations between the DPRK and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We strongly demand the Japanese government immediately lift its \"sanctions\" against the vice-chairmen of the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon and drop all other unreasonable \"sanctions\" and, at the same time, ensure the human rights and life of the Koreans in Japan."

            "content": "DPRK's \"Missile Threat\", No More Than Excuse: Russian Expert \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, February 16 (KCNA) -- According to the Voice of Russia, an expert of Russia said that the \"missile threat\" from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, touted by some forces, is no more than an excuse and the missile crisis in Asia is ascribable to the United States,.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean defence minister's recent call for beefing up missile potential is what was expected, as it was a result of the confab between the U.S. and south Korea, Alexandr Vorontsov, a researcher at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The researcher further said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In October last year, the U.S. gave a green light to south Korea's proposal on extending the range of missile up to 800 kilometers. The approval evoked different responses from the international community.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Foreign Ministry of Russia expressed apprehension over it. It was because such move would spark off a new round of arms race, missile race in the Korean Peninsula. Now the south Korean authorities claim that the measure was taken to cope with the nuclear test conducted by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The escalated missile crisis in Asia is due to the U.S behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe agreement signed between south Korea and the U.S. in the past suggested that the former can get access to missiles with a range of less than 300 kilometers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present the U.S. allowed south Korea to extend it up to 800 kilometers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Besides, it schemes to offer south Korea the information obtained from satellites and drones, should south Korea set up an integrated MD system, which is a part of the theatre missile defence system sought by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's \"missile threat\" is no more than an excuse."
