This was a sheer burlesque. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, Ri should have made a \"declaration of conscience\" over his wrongs long ago.\r\n If he is truly in the mood of reflecting on his wrongs and making atonement for them, he should frankly confess how much money he wrested from business groups at the time of the last \"presidential election\", how much and for what purpose he spent and how much he embezzled for himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His \"apology\" made at the press conference is not true and came too late as the saying after dinner, mustard goes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the conference he said that he would go to prison, feeling fully responsible for all the wrongs with a \"solemn resolution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut he did not tell truth. The traitor is bound to go prison for he has done and this is the judgement by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP raised illicit political funds amounting to astronomical figures, the money collected from the people as taxes, to meet its partisan interests and kicked up dust to conceal the scandal, creating a great political confusion in south Korea. With nothing can it cover up such crimes or get pardoned by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The only option for the GNP is to immediately dissolve the corrupt party of traitors as demanded by the south Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Under this situation the DPRK is left with no option but to cope with this military threat with a military deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear deterrent force is a decisive means for coping with the U.S. threat of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. used a huge amount of depleted uranium shells, a type of nuclear weapon, when attacking Iraq, a country with no strategic forces and with very weak military capacity in terms of latest weaponry. It is self-evident that it will use nuclear weapons of higher performance when it invades the DPRK, a country with strong military power. As a matter of fact, the U.S. attempted to use nuclear weapons during the last Korean war and whenever shocking military incidents occurred in the postwar period. During his south Korean junket in November last U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld openly declared that it would use nuclear weapons in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula. This proves that the U.S. is increasing threat to the DPRK with nukes as the days go by while watching for a chance to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it, after officially listing it as a target of nuclear attack. This situation compels the DPRK to keep and steadily increase its nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. threat to use nukes against the DPRK and its policy to stifle Pyongyang the DPRK would not have troubled itself and exerted so much effort to build up a nuclear deterrent force. It is none other than the U.S. which compelled the DPRK to build up the nuclear deterrent force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they fully supported the fair and aboveboard steps taken by the DPRK to cope with such moves of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the DPRK government issued a statement on its withdrawal from NPT on January 10 than a total of 400 or more newspapers, news agencies and radios worldwide reported it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Washington Post, the New York Times and other newspapers of the U.S. viewed the policy of the Bush administration bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of tension as an anachronistic policy, a clumsy policy, a gross blunder and a confused mistake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, many public figures and thousands of people in Egypt, Finland, Sweden, Nepal, Ecuador and Bangladesh staged anti-U.S., anti-war demonstrations with placards reading \"We denounce the U.S. aggressive moves against the DPRK,\" chanting \"Long live north Korea!\" and other slogans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Indonesian president, the Swedish king, the Ugandan president, the Tanzanian president and the secretary general of the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania, the sultan of Brunei Darussalam and other heads of state and leaders of political parties of different countries, when they met with DPRK ambassadors to their countries, hoped that the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. would be settled peacefully through dialogue, not by a war threat or blockade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea and other international and regional organizations in their statements, appeals and information bulletins demanded that the U.S. which caused the nuclear issue respond to the peaceful and affirmative proposal of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Peace Council and its Asia-Pacific regional meeting, the 16th Meeting of the Presidential Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions, a seminar of communist and workers' parties in Europe for solidarity with the DPRK, an international meeting of organizations for friendship with the Korean people and meetings of other international and regional organizations in their resolutions, statements, action programs and other official documents urged the U.S. to withdraw its policy of preemptive attack on the DPRK and sign a non-aggression treaty with it. They also opposed all the attempts of the U.S. to internationalize the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and demanded it find the way for its settlement by means of dialogue on the principle of simultaneous actions to remove concerns of both sides simultaneously. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A joint meeting of international democratic organizations and Asian regional organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people held in Sri Lanka published an \"appeal to the world progressives, international democratic organizations and organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people wanting a peaceful solution of the issue on the Korean peninsula\" and the World Peace Council and other international and regional organizations and figures, peace organizations and trade union figures of different countries signed the appeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Australian Peace Committee and the Australian Friends of the Earth started a signature campaign in June calling for conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. and peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nParticipating in it were at least 400 organizations of more than 50 countries and the Dismantlement-2,000 having over 2,000 affiliated organizations and more than 30 other international and regional organizations in three months.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
