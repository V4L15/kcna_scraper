Now that the right-wing conservative forces are keen on conspiracy and alliance under the signboard of \"New Right,\" it is natural for all the forces in south Korea aspiring after progress and reforms and reunification to achieve a great alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  There are in south Korea many reunification movement organizations for implementing the June 15 joint declaration and aspiring after a democratic society and dissident and civic movement organizations with progressive tendency. If various circles of south Korea achieve a great alliance against conservatives under the banner of democracy and reunification, they will display really herculean strength.\r\n If broad segments of south Korean people struggle in firm unity under the banner of the great alliance against conservatives, they will certainly defeat the pro-U.S. conservative forces no matter how desperately they may try, and successfully achieve social progress and reforms and conduct a more dynamic movement for independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu made tenacious efforts to attain the bold goal of building the Samsu Power Station by their own efforts, pushing forward the project at a rapid pace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the successful completion of the most difficult objects in the project they are pushing ahead with the dam construction and generator assembling at a final phase.\r\n After being briefed on the construction of the power station before a huge painting showing a panoramic view of the station, he went round the construction site to learn in detail about the progress of the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly pleased to see the nation's another structure of eternal value rising, noting that the station is located in a good place and designed well through the strict adherence to the principle of profitability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He commanded a bird's-eye view of the long dam extending across a ravine and worksites reminiscent of battle fields. He highly appreciated the feats performed by them, greatly pleased to learn that they have done a huge amount of work in a brief span of time in the same spirit of devotedly defending the country as was displayed in the 1950s and in the spirit of \"the Arduous March\" in the 1990s when the people pulled through the grim ordeal in a do-or-die spirit. He extended thanks to all the builders who are working by the sweat of their brow with loyalty for the prosperity of the country.\r\n It is, indeed, a signal success that the builders active in the construction sites of revolutionary battle sites have constructed a lot of modern structures to be handed down to posterity in various places by their own efforts despite so hard conditions under the uplifted slogan of faith \"When the Party Is Determined, We Can Do Anything!\", he said, adding that this precious fruition is a clear manifestation of the great mental power which can be displayed only by our people single-mindedly united around the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for expediting the construction of the power station, underscoring the need to build the power station as an edifice of eternal value as it is the nation's treasure that would greatly contribute to the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that before completing the construction of the power station it is necessary to pay primary attention to fully guaranteeing the living of the evacuated inhabitants.\r\n Not the slightest inconvenience should be caused to those inhabitants as many houses will be moved from the waterlogged area after the completion of the power station, he said, stressing that to this end it is necessary to take thorough-going measures including the construction of dwelling houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He pointed out that as the construction of the power station is a vast project that calls for doing a huge amount of work the cabinet, ministries, national institutions and relevant domains should render sincere assistance to the builders and supply sufficient quantities of materials and equipment necessary for the project in time.\r\n He called for concentrating all efforts on the construction of the power station, noting that it is possible to complete the project much earlier than scheduled if officials scrupulously organize the work now that the construction has passed the most difficult phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He urged the builders intensely loyal to the party and the revolution to work hard with the same vim and vigor with which they have achieved great victory by boldly pulling through all difficulties and thus fully demonstrate the heroic stamina of Songun Korea and wind up the construction as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of his on-the-spot guidance to the construction site of the power station he together with the builders watched a performance given by the Merited State Chorus of the Korean People's Army.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

For instance, last year witnessed the 4th talks of the foreign ministers of those countries in Vladivostok. The foreign ministers re-clarified the stance that they support the establishment of a fair world order based on the democratization and multi-polarization of the international relations. The cooperation between Russia and India is growing stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, at the end of the 1990s Russia proposed the formation of a joint front by Russia, China and India to cope with the U.S. plan for the expansion of the NATO and the U.S. Missile Defense system. It is now believed to be at the stage of its realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The EU is also stepping up its moves to contain the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and create its own forces for collective defence in a bid to strengthen its position and increase its influence as an independent polar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is noteworthy in the moves for a multi-polar world is the developing countries. \r\n Now the developing countries hold a collective position to reckon with in the international arena and play a big role in promoting the multi-polarization of the world.\r\nThe alliance among developing countries and their integrated regions are strongly opposed to the U.S. imperialists' moves for world domination and contain the U.S. moves for uni-polar world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The significance of the trend towards a multi-polar world lies in that it has significantly weakened the position of the U.S. imperialists as the \"only super power\" and created an environment favorable for the development of the impartial international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its significance also lies in that this trend keeps any specified forces from unilaterally dominating the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said trend is, in the final analysis, helpful to building a new fair international order and promoting the cause of global independence.\r\n No force on earth can stem the trend towards a multi-poplar world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And then he visited Taedong County, South Phyongan Province, and various other local areas and met peasants to acquaint himself with what amount of tenanted land they cultivated and how they would do farming after land distribution.\r\n In this course he confirmed the objects of land confiscation, methods of confiscation and distribution, the way for liquidating the tenant system and so on to suit the actual conditions of the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, he pushed ahead with the work of raising the political consciousness and class awakening among the peasants, who were in direct charge of the land reform, through various activities including the struggle for the three-to-seven system of tenancy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having created all preconditions favorable for the land reform, he promulgated the historic Law on Land Reform in North Korea on March 5, 1946.\r\n The land reform was carried out in a matter of 20 days, after the proclamation of the law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, more than a million hectares of land owned by Japanese imperialists, pro-Japanese elements, traitors to the nation and landlords were confiscated without compensation to be distributed to over 720,000 landless or land-poor peasant households free of charge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The feudal relations of ownership and exploiting system were totally liquidated in the rural communities of the country once and for all and the peasants became genuine master of the land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The land, the question of which was solved by the President, has been rezoned into large-sized standardized fields under the leadership of Kim Jong Il in the Songun era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Retaked Monument to Victory Battle\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tokyo, March 5 (KNS) -- As the Korean Central News Agency reported , a ceremony of handing over the monument to the victory in the battle in the northern area of Korea took place March 1 at the Kaesong Koryo Museum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The monument has a record of the historical facts that the Korean volunteer army defeated the Japanese intruders into the area of Hamgyong Province of Korea in the period of the Imjin Patriotic War (1592-1598).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  When the Japanese aggression army invaded Korea 1904 under the pretext of Russo-Japanese war, Ikeda, commanding officer of the army, saw the monument standing in Rimmyongyok (now Kim Chaek City) of North Hamgyong Province in 1905.\r\nAt that time he grumbled that such monument standing there would touch off strong anti-Japanese sentiment among Koreans and this would not be in favor of Japan's enforcement of the rule of colonial enslavement over Korea.\r\n Then it was shipped to Tokyo in secrecy in 1906. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese aggressors considered the monument too wonderful and excellent in its stone material and sculptural art to destroy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It had thus been preserved until recently as \"a trophy\" from their colony.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What was more serious was that it was left in a corner of the \"Yasukuni Shrine\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The restoration of the monument is the fruition of joint effort of N-S parties concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The monument will be preserved in original place, Kim Chaek City in North Hamgyong Province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
