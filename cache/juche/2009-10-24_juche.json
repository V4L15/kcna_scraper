He gave a high appreciation of the fact that the workers of the complex have creditably discharged their role as forerunners in implementing the Party's economic line and creating a new culture, and had a photo session with its labor innovators.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe next leg of his guidance was the Huichon Silk Mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe made rounds of various production processes to learn in detail about the conditions of technical equipment and production at the mill and highly estimated its workers' achievements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe urged the mill to intensify the modernization of production processes and steadily increase production capacity and thus put itself on world level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe stressed that the mill should provide silk fabrics works with larger quantity of quality silk to meet the lifelong desire of President Kim Il Sung, who took much pain to ensure that all the people wear silks and live on rice and meat soup in tile-roofed houses, as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe also visited Huichon University of Technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter being briefed on the university before a map on its panoramic view, he looked round a room dedicated to the history of the university. He said that the undying revolutionary feats performed by Kim Il Sung for the development of Juche-based education would remain long with the history of the university.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe acquainted himself with the details of intellectual education and scientific research at the university and highly estimated the achievements made by its teaching staff in training of scientific and technical personnel and scientific research.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSaying that a large number of graduates of this university are now playing the pivotal role in solving many scientific and technological problems arising in various fields of the national economy and blazing the path to new scientific and technological sphere because the university has steadily improved the qualitative level of education true to the Party's policy of education, he highly appreciated again the merits performed by the teaching staff and students of the university on behalf of the Party, the revolution, the country and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that the university should turn out more technical personnel able to greatly help further consolidate the foundation of the independent national economy and display its potentials to the full.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe urged the university to briskly open up new fields of science and technology and thus make positive contribution to radically developing the nation's science and technology as a whole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe striking changes taking place in Jagang Province are a vivid manifestation of our people's steadfast will to build a great prosperous and powerful nation with our efforts and resources in this land at any cost, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Chief Secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK Pak To Chun and Secretary Kim Ki Nam, Department Directors Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek and First Vice Department Directors Ju Kyu Chang, Ri Je Gang and Ri Jae Il of the WPK Central Committee."

The width of its entrance is 6 meters, its length from the entrance to the end is 32 meters and its height is 13.7 meters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe archaeologists found that two layers of culture had existed there in the period from the middle term to the latter one of the Old Stone Age while excavating the sedimentary stratum of the cavern.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore than 30 pieces of stone tools including cutter, hand-taking axe, thrusting tool, scraper belonging to the middle term of the Old Stone Age were discovered in the first layer of culture and more than 2,000 pieces of stone tools such as pusher, carving tool and stone blade belonging to the latter term in the second layer of culture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat attracts attention among the relics and remains is seven pieces of human fossils tantamount to five bodies excavated in the second layer of culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTwo upper jaw-bones and three lower jaw-bones were confirmed as those of Modern men who had lived nearly 20000-60000 years ago.

            "content": "Descubiertas en Corea mas de 14 mil reliquias de la edad paleolitica\r\nPyongyang, 24 de octubre (ATCC) -- En la caverna Chongphadae del distrito de Hwangju de la provincia de Hwanghae del Norte, descubierta recientemente por los cientificos de la Universidad Kim Il Sung, fueron desenterrados mas de 14 mil objetos de la edad paleolitica. \n\t\t\t\t\tEsa caverna esta situada a 34 km al sudoeste de Komunmoru, famosas ruinas de la misma era situadas en el distrito de Sangwon de la ciudad de Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe trata de una cueva de piedra calcarea que tiene 6 metros de ancho de entrada, 32 metros de largo desde esta hasta el otro extremo y 13.7 metros de alto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante el descubrimiento del estrato sedimentario de la cueva, los cientificos aclararon que alli han existido dos culturas: una de la epoca intermedia de la edad paleolitica y la otra del tiempo posterior de la misma edad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDel estrato de la primera cultura salieron mas de 30 utensilios de piedra, entre otros, hachas de mano, lanzas y rascadores y de la capa de la segunda cultura, mas de 2 mil como arrolladores, grabadores y piedras afiladas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que atrae mas atencion es 7 fosiles del hombre correspondientes a 5 individuos que fueron hallados en el segundo estrato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los fosiles como dos maxilares y tres quijadas tienen formas claras y estan bien conservados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe comprobo que son de los hombres de la edad Neolitica que existieron hace entre 20 mil y 60 mil anos, aproximadamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mas antiguo de ellos es de entre 40 mil y 60 mil anejos, aproximadamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs de un hombre que vivio a principios de la edad neolitica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl circulo arqueologico de Corea lo nombro como \"persona de Hwangju\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hallazgo resulta el primero en la region de Asia del Este.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos sitios de fogata descubiertos en varios puntos bastan para imaginar que los antecesores coreanos habian usado el fuego desde la remota antiguedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la caverna Chongphadae fueron encontrados tambien mas de 10 mil fosiles de animales como rinoceronte de grandes cuernos, rinoceronte peludo, venado de gran cuerno, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstas especies, que habitaban en las pasadas epocas geologicas, no existen actualmente en Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien fueron descubiertos mas de mil 570 fosiles de espora y polen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos nuevos hallazgos arqueologicos comprueban mejor de modo cientifico y teorico que ya en los albores de la historia de la especie humana, las personas vivian en la cuenca del rio Taedong, cuyo centro es Pyongyang, creando su propia cultura."
