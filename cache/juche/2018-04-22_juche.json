The memorandum was issued on Saturday to mark the 70th anniversary of the Joint Conference of Representatives of Political Parties and Social Organizations in North and South Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum said it is the line of national reunification consistently maintained by Kim Il Sung since the first day of national division that Korea should not be bisected but reunified in line with the common will and demand of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It noted that Kim Il Sung made a proposal of convening a joint conference of representatives of political parties and public organizations in North and South Korea in his speech \"On the Proposal for North-South Negotiations\" made at a meeting of the corps of chairmen of the Central Committee of the Democratic National United Front of North Korea in October 1947 when the U.S. imperialists resorted to all sorts of vicious moves to hold \"separate elections\" and form a \"separate government\" under the signboard of the United Nations, and wisely led the struggle for realizing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the joint conference successfully took place in Pyongyang on April 19-23, 1948 with the attendance of 695 representatives of 56 political parties and public organizations in the north and the south of Korea, the memorandum stressed that the April joint conference was a brilliant fruition of Kim Il Sung's independent line of national reunification and idea of great national unity and the first historic victory won by the pro-reunification patriotic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It referred to the fact that he had wisely led the struggle for achieving the great unity of the nation and reunifying the country on the basis of the experience and success made in the above-said joint conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It lauded leader Kim Jong Il as the eternal sun of the nation who defended and carried forward Kim Il Sung's idea of great national unity and exploits and thus developed the struggle for national unity and reunification onto a new higher level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said that Kim Jong Il energetically guided the work for building a revolutionary site and erecting the United Front Tower on Ssuk Islet where a consultative meeting was held with the south Korean representatives who participated in the joint conference. Under his energetic guidance, a monument to the autograph of Kim Il Sung was erected in Panmunjom, a symbol of division, as the icon of national reunification, to convey his exploits for national reunification and a monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification towered imposingly in Thongil Street of Pyongyang, it added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il made public a large number of works to comprehensively develop in depth Kim Il Sung's idea of great national unity and clearly show the most correct road of national unity and reunification to all compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ushered in a new era of great national unity with his far-sighted plan of national reunification, broad magnanimity and warm fraternity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great leaders' idea of great national unity and exploits and their rich experience and tradition are now being successfully carried forward and developed by the respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un developed in depth the great leaders' idea and line of great national unity to suit the new historical phase and has taken a series of epoch-making and realistic measures for carrying them into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation on the Korean peninsula frozen due to antagonism and confrontation has now entered a phase of thaw thanks to Kim Jong Un's patriotic will and bold decision to make a great turn and change in the north-south relations through the great unity of the whole nation and open up a new phase of independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the outstanding and tested guidance of Kim Jong Un who has creditably inherited the great leaders' noble idea of great national unity, fine spring of sprouting and blooming and autumn of rich harvest only will await the Koreans aspiring after great national unity and reunification, the memorandum concluded."
