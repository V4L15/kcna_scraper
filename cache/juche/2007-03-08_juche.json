But there are still open acts of distorting and denying the history of aggression in Japan. This cannot but be very grave and dangerous developments. The crime committed in drafting \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army is one of the most inhuman crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' despicable distortion of history is an intolerable insult to the Korean people, the victim, and a deliberate artifice to refuse to admit the crime and evade the settlement of the past at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have not yet renounced the militaristic view of history and view of domination. Typical manifestation of this is the attempts to distort the crime committed in drafting \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army. They are working deliberately to reverse the history of aggression and cram militaristic consciousness into the heads of the Japanese people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To try to cover up the past crimes immediately means they intend to follow in the footsteps of the predecessors who committed those crimes. The Japanese reactionaries are increasing pressure upon the DPRK, persistently raising a hue and cry over the already settled \"abduction issue.\" This is linked with their scheme of reinvasion of Korea. The distortion of history, evasion of settlement of the past crimes and outcries over \"threat\" from someone vividly indicate the process of the preparations of the Japanese militarists to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to give up the foolish dream of attaining their sinister purpose through the shameless distortion of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. aggressor forces are strutting about there, receiving the funds for their upkeep amounting to astronomical figures every year, and DPRK-targeted large-scale military maneuvers do not cease. All this is a product of the south Korean ultra-right conservative forces' sycophancy towards the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea are still engaged in the acts of treachery dancing to the tune of the U.S. war outcry against the DPRK though the nation lives in the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The realization of the above-said alliance provides a way of removing the source of confrontation between the north and the south and achieving the peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces in south Korea are a wicked group of traitors whose means of existence is to foster confrontation between compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even since the advent of the June 15 era of independent reunification those forces have more recklessly pursued confrontation between compatriots, swimming against the trend of the times towards national co-operation, unity and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These desperate moves of these forces to hurt compatriots, brandishing swords against the progressive and patriotic forces, bring back the fascist tyranny dating back to the era of dictatorship in south Korea and cause unpleasant things to happen between the north and the south more often than not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These developments hamstring the progress of the cause of peace and reunification and throw a stumbling block in the way of bringing security to the nation and peace to the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation urgently calls on all the progressive and patriotic forces in south Korea to realize the anti-conservative great alliance and thus smash the moves of the ultra-right conservative forces to incite inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the reality proves, to realize the above-mentioned alliance is a struggle for defending peace on the Korean Peninsula and achieving its peaceful reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Abe's Reckless Remarks under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Abe, grandson of Class A war criminal, is obliged to more straightforwardly and sincerely reflect on the past crimes of Japan than anyone else and settle them. A spokesman for the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to \"Comfort Women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army and the Victims of Forcible Drafting said this in a statement Wednesday lashing out at Abe who, when interviewed by media, openly distorted and defended the heinous crimes related to sexual slavery committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past, asserting that there is no evidence proving the coercion involved in sexual slavery for the Japanese military mentioned in \"Kono's statement.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of late the international community has become increasingly critical of the crimes perpetrated by Japan against humanity as evidenced by the fact that a resolution holding the Japanese government accountable for the crimes related to sexual slavery was presented to Congress of the U.S., its senior ally, and its victims testified to the crimes, the statement noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by the above-mentioned development, the Japanese reactionaries let high-ranking officials grumble that it was regrettable and undesirable, while hastily dispatching right-wing politicians and even an adviser to the prime minister to the U.S. for lobbying operations. All this is aimed at deterring the above-said resolution from passing through Congress. Irony is that the prime minister took the lead in this diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard one cannot but recall the fact that two years ago Abe forced NHK to modify its TV program introducing the \"Tokyo International Women's Court on War Crimes\" which ruled that the Japanese government and the Japanese emperor were responsible for the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" and floated the lie that members of the DPRK delegation to the \"court\" were \"operatives from the north\" only to become a laughing stock of the world. This once again strips bare his true colors as a political charlatan and shameless man as he dares negate history and discards even ethics and morality in a bid to realize his own sinister political ambition.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly indicates how vulgar Japan has become in its conscience and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the revival of Japanese militarism that the Japanese authorities are seeking by zealously defending the hideous wartime crimes committed by their predecessors, challenging the unanimous denunciation and censure of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revival of militarism in Japan would only lead it to ruin, not \"beautiful Japan\" much touted by Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No denial can ever write off or tamper with history. Japan will certainly be forced to pay for the crimes related to the sexual slavery.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
