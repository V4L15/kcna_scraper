It said: \"The south Korean society is now in the grip of the extreme crisis due to the present regime's self-righteousness and arbitrariness. Democracy achieved at the cost of blood exists only in name. The south-north relations have stepped back to those before June 25, far from making a step forward towards reunification\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dissident organizations in south Korea said that the specter that haunted in the era of dictatorship revived, condemning the unpopular rule of the puppet group as \"cannibalistic politics\", \"horrible politics based on brutality and frenzy\" and \"politics aimed at not seeking people's understanding but killing them\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also labeled the puppet authorities \"a regime violating democracy and killing common people\", \"a regime disregarding the people\" and \"an intransigent regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Terming the present chief executive's campaign for economic recovery hypocritical, the white paper noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Citizens Federation for Economic Justice of south Korea said that an analysis of the commitments made by the puppet group to improving the standard of people's living in last February led to the conclusion that none of them has been properly fulfilled, assessing its three years in power as a failure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An opinion poll was made on the three years of its office. 74.6 percent of its respondents said they do not believe the policy of the authorities while 81.3 percent of the respondents predicted that the present regime would not be able to settle the economic crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A politician from an opposition party said that the people are groaning due to the four big problems related to their living: sky-rocketing prices, snowballing money for the lease of a house or room, serious joblessness and foot-and-mouth diseases, adding that it is better to call south Korea a \"republic beset with serious problems\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean people are assailing the authorities for having driven the inter-Korean relations into a collapse and increased the danger of a war in denial and violation of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, the white paper noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People of various circles in south Korea dismiss \"the waiting strategy\" and \"adherence to the principle\" touted by the conservative group as a far-fetched assertion aimed to shun dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey call the Ministry of Unification as \"ministry which gave up reunification\", \"ministry for confrontation\" and \"ministry seeking permanent division.\" They, at the same time, brand puppet minister of Unification Hyon In Thaek as \"a top class criminal who brought the south-north relations to a collapse\" and a \"speculator for anti-reunification acts,\" demanding that he be brought to justice before any others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the results of the recent opinion poll in south Korea, 84.7 percent of the respondents said that they felt uneasy as it seemed that a war may break out at once while 80 percent of them urged the \"government\" to roll back its policy of confrontation and opt for dialogue with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the puppet group's sycophancy towards the U.S. and Japan and treachery, south Korean media are ridiculing it as \"a servant for the U.S.\", \"a government being deceived by the U.S. and hit on its head by Japan\" and \"a regime subservient to the U.S. and a regime courteous towards Japan and a good-for-nothing for the people\". They are heaping curses on the authorities, slashing at above-said sycophancy and treachery as \"crazy diplomacy,\" \"servile diplomacy,\" \"shameful diplomacy,\" \"foolish diplomacy,\" \"diplomacy of idiots,\" \"diplomacy for bringing tribute to other countries\", \"mendicant diplomacy\" and \"diplomacy made with empty cans\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people's curse and condemnation of the puppet group have reached the brink of explosion, the white paper noted, warning that  the conservative group being forsaken by the people is bound to face a stern judgment by history and the nation and meet a miserable end."

La democracia conquistada con sangre existe sólo formalmente. Las relaciones íntercoreanas dieron marcha atrás al estado antes del 25 de junio (día de inicio de la pasada guerra coreana) sin dar ni un paso adelante hacia la reunificación\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas entidades de activistas opinaron que se ha resucitado el fantasma de la época de dictadura y calificaron la política antipopular de la camarilla de autoridades títeres como la \"política caníbal\", \"la pavorosa de barbaridad y locura\" y la \"de exterminio del pueblo sin la menor comunicación con éste\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefinieron a las autoridades títeres como \"el poder asesino que acaba con la democracia y mata a los humildes\", \"el poder que desprecia al pueblo\", \"el poder inválido\", etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la farsa de revitalización de la economía orquestada por el actual mandatario surcoreano, la Federación de Ciudadanos por la Economía Justa del Sur de Corea reveló que no se ha cumplido ninguna de las promesas relacionadas con la vida del pueblo presentadas en febrero del año pasado por la banda de títeres y calificó de suspenso los 3 años del poder actual. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe acuerdo con el resultado de la encuesta realizada con motivo de cumplirse 3 años de mandato del poder actual, 74.6% no confían en la política de las autoridades y 81.3% dijeron que éstas son incapaces de resolver la crisis económica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn político del partido opositor dijo que los habitantes surcoreanos sufren 4 tipos de caos que incluyen el de precios, el de alquiler anticipado, el de empleos y el de fiebre aftosa y describió el Sur de Corea como \"la república de grandes caos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes surcoreanos denuncian a las autoridades que aumentaron la crisis de guerra negando y violando la Declaración Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaración del 4 de Octubre y llevando las relaciones íntercorenas a la ruptura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos surcoreanos de distintos sectores subrayan que la banda de conservadores insiste en la \"estrategia de espera\" y el \"mantenimiento de principios\" con el fin de no acudir al diálogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalifican al Ministerio de Reunificación como \"el ministerio que renunció la reunificación\", \"el de enfrentamiento\" y \"el de división\" e insisten en llevar primero al banquillo de acusados al titular de esa cartera Hyon In Thaek tildándolo como \"criminal de peor calaña que frustró las relaciones íntercoreanas\" y el \"especulador anti-reunificación\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegún el resultado de las recientes encuestas, 84. 7 % de los consultados expresaron su preocupación por el posible estallido de guerra y 80 % demandaron que el \"gobierno\" cancele su política conflictiva con el Norte y proceda al diálogo con éste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos medios de prensa surcoreanos ironizan el servilismo vendepatria a EE.UU. y Japón de la camarilla surcoreana usando estas expresiones: \"sirviente de EE.UU.\", \"gobierno embaucado por EE.UU. y golpeado por Japón por la espalda\" y \"el bueno para EE.UU., el cortés para Japón y el inútil para el pueblo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la diplomacia surcoreana, le envían improperios de toda clase como \"la loca\", \"la sumisa\", \"la vergonzosa\", etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cólera y la condena del pueblo contra la banda de autoridades títeres llegan al borde de explosión.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta camarilla repudiada por el pueblo llegará a su trágico fin siendo condenada severamente por la historia y la nación."
