Since then, many Japanese companies have taken part in the development and production of missiles. Various kinds of missiles are being mass-produced in Komaki, one of leading missile producers in Japan.\r\n   What is all the more dangerous is the fact that Japan is turning out means of nuclear delivery after completing the home production of missiles.\r\n   Having launched the first artificial satellite in the 1970s, it armed the \"self-defence forces\" with various kinds of rockets, guided missiles and other means of nuclear delivery in the mid-1970s.\r\n   On the other hand, the \"self-defence forces\" have intensified missile strike trainings, crying that modern warfare is an electronic war and a war of forestalling strikes through missiles.\r\n   It is not accidental that most of the 13 war exercises staged abroad in 1993 were missile-firing drills.\r\n   As seen above, missile threats are now coming from Japan.\r\n   Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities are trying to find faults with the DPRK, alleging that the DPRK's satellite launch is a \"missile launch.\" this is like \"the guilty party filing the suit first.\"\r\n   Japan cannot conceal its criminal and aggressive nature as the very state which is threatening others with missiles. \r\n\r\n"
