I am convinced that Korea would be reunified and become a powerful and prosperous country in the near future. \r\n\r\n"

They committed too many crimes to enumerate.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the present Japanese chief executive tries hard to cover up such hideous crimes with a few words and did not even touch upon the issue of governmental apology and compensation for the Japanese imperialists' invasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese government has sidestepped the issue of its redress for its past under this or that pretext, dragging out it for over half a century. Germany, a war criminal state, is redeeming its past crimes through governmental apology and compensation for all its war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK states once again that Japan should redress its past by making a governmental apology and compensation on the basis of admitting the Japanese imperialists' acts of aggression. Only this will be a true apology and compensation for their aggression and can convince people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's redeem for its past should not be delayed indefinitely. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should drop such a foolish attempt to gloss over the issue of its redeem for its past. \r\n\r\n"

This is pride and dignity of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A newspaper reporter, Ri Yun Mi, said that she came to ask herself if the south has not been engrossed in music for music's sake and music for the sake of musicians, realizing that the north has channelled efforts into the development of music for the people, popular music. \"It seems to me that through the performance of the state symphony orchestra I have found an orientation, that is what should be focus of the policy for culture including music,\" she added. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
