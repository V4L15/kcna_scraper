Given that the U.S. persists in slinging mud at the DPRK, it can not but say what it should say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the issue of violating the people's freedom, it is not the DPRK but the U.S. which should be called to question. \r\n The \"U.S.-style freedom\" claimed to be standards of the U.S. human rights, is based on the amount of dollars. This reduces people to slaves of money and deprives the overwhelming majority of working people in the U.S. of freedom of elementary human rights and right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights precisely mean sovereign rights of a state. The U.S. has committed countless crimes of violating the sovereign rights of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never deny the fact that it carried out over 70 wars and countless cases of military intervention in the past, violating the sovereignty of other countries and the human rights of their people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the pretext of \"human rights issue\" the U.S. has interfered in the internal affairs of the countries situated in the major regions rich in natural resources and in the areas of military strategic importance and used force of arms allegedly to settle regional issues and disputes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that the U.S. cited \"human rights issue\" of a country as a pretext to use \"force\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the U.S. is vociferous about \"human rights issues\" to meet its political interests. It is talking about the \"human rights situation\" in the DPRK while keeping mum about its wrongdoings. This can convince no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. styles itself a \"human rights judge\" though it is the land with the world's poorest human rights record. It, therefore, cannot but stand censured by the international community.    \r\n\r\n"

It did mental, human and material damage to the Korean people for over 40 years after occupying it early in the 20th century. This was the worst crime in human history in view of their form, method, content and scope. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan kidnapped and drafted by force more than 6 million young and middle-aged Koreans and killed at least one million of them after forcing them to do mediaeval slave labour. This was an unpardonable monstrous crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan forced nearly 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the \"Japanese Imperial Army,\" the most hideous crime against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the last Korean War, too, Japan not only rendered cooperation to the U.S. Imperialist's War of aggression against the DPRK, but took a direct part in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan plundered Korea after invading it and has repeatedly stood in the way of Korea's reunification and progress for one century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These crimes earned Japan an ill-fame of being the Korean people's sworn enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable stand and unshakable will of the Korean people to force Japan by every possible means and method to redress its past crimes in the present generation at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan remains hostile toward the DPRK while turning aside from the issue of redressing its past, it will touch off the Korean people's bitter wrath against Japan and it will not escape from a deserved punishment.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
