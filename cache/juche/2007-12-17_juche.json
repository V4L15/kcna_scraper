RSOI, Foal Eagle, Ulji Focus Lens joint military exercises and other war exercises were nothing but a large-scale preliminary war, nuclear test war to preempt strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military authorities of the U.S., Japan and Australia held tripartite military talks, the first of their kind, in Singapore this year at which they agreed to jointly react to the DPRK's \"nuclear and missile issue\". In their wake, they conducted various attack operations including landing operation in the Pacific Ocean and street battle under the simulated conditions of an actual war with tens of thousands of troops and warships and other huge combat equipment involved. This indicates that the military actions of the U.S., Japan and Australia aimed at the second Korean war have been brought into spotlight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces kicked up the madcap military ruckus against the dialogue partner, quite contrary to the atmosphere in which the points agreed at the six-party talks for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and stability on it were in the process of implementation and multi-faceted dialogue and cooperation projects underway between the north and the south. This is an outright challenge to the DPRK and an act of harassing peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the U.S. military chief blustered that it is necessary to get the U.S. forces fully ready for a war to cope with the \"threat\" from someone and underscored the need to increase military spending and bolster modern armed forces to this end. He even bragged that the U.S. forces are having various war scenarios in the making under the simulated conditions of a Korean war and a crisis in the Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, but for the DPRK's self-restraint, patience and strong war deterrent, there would have been a catastrophic situation on the Korean Peninsula this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces should not misinterpret the peace-loving DPRK's efforts and patience as a sign of weakness but had better behave with discretion.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The idea represents the idea of national self-determination that the national problem should be settled by the Koreans themselves free from any foreign interference and the confidence and optimism that the Korean nation is fully capable of carving out its own destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea also reflects the desire of the nation for peace and the peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace is a prerequisite to national unity and the independent reunification of the country. The Korean nation will suffer again a catastrophic disaster and the land of Korea will turn into shambles of a nuclear war launched by outside forces unless the Koreans defend peace from a new war in this land. Only when there are the nation and the land can there be reconciliation, cooperation, reunification and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned idea serves as a banner of struggle and a powerful engine which makes it possible for the Koreans to save the destiny of the nation and open up a new history of the nation for reunification and prosperity as all the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas absolutely support and sympathize with and implement it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
