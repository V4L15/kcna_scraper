            "content": "WPK's policy of giving priority to army is invincible\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The newspaper Rodong Sinmun and the magazine Kulloja, organs of the Central Committee  of the Worker's Party of Korea, published a joint article entitled \"Our party's policy of giving priority to army is invincible.\"   The joint article is carried in Rodong Sinmun today.   Its keynote is that the WPK's policy of giving priority to the army is the perfect mode of politics in the present times, an invincible politics which emerges ever victorious in confrontation with imperialism and a wise politics which ushers in a new era of prosperity and that the Korean revolution will always win under this politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The first part of the joint article refers to the perfect mode of politics in our times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It says:   The Korean revolution has advanced triumphantly under the great politics of giving priority to the army.   The mode of give-priority-to-the-army policy is a mode of leadership which solves all problems arising in the revolution and construction on the principle of giving top precedence to the military affairs and pushes ahead with the socialist cause as a whole, putting forward the army as the pillar of the revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK's policy of giving priority to the army is the most popular politics centred on the popular masses.   It is based on the revolutionary philosophy that the army is precisely the party, people and state.   Attaching great importance to the army means giving primary importance to the people,  while putting forward the army as the pillar of the revolution means giving the popular masses a position of master of the revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Creative energy of the people is inexhaustible . If this energy is to be given fullest play, the people should put forward the  revolutionary army as an example and learn from it and the whole society should be replete with the fighting spirit and stamina of the people's army. The army-first policy is aimed to realize this.\r\n   The WPK's policy of giving priority to the army is the most independent politics of hewing out the road of the revolution with the internal force.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the army is strong, there will be no need to read other's face or be despised by others. Independence and self-supporting in economy are possible only when there is self-reliance in defence.   If socialist politics is to be truly independent, military affairs must be put forward and the military forces be strengthened in every way. This is a serious lesson drawn from the history of socialist politics in the 20th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The WPK's policy of giving priority to the military affairs is a far-sighted policy of providing guarantee for the future of the revolution.   It is very dangerous to approach military affairs in a short-sighted manner in administering socialist politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It should not be allowed in the socialist politics  under any circumstances that less efforts  are directed to the military affairs  in a peaceful situation than in a tense situation and that the strengthening of the national defense  is neglected when socio-economic tasks come to the fore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A statesman with clairvoyant wisdom always concentrates on the military affairs, foreseeing future developments. It is possible to deal with economic malaise. But, once the military power is weakened, the nation's framework of eternal value will break down. Bright is the future of the revolution in which efforts are made to adhere to the  principle of giving priority to the military affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the second part the article refers to the invincible politics which gives guarantee for certain victory in confrontation with imperialism.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist cause inevitably goes with fierce face-off with imperialism, the article says, and continues:   The WPK's policy of priority given to the military affairs is very instrumental in winning a victory in serious ideological stand-off with imperialism.   Ideological disarmament of the army leads to collapse of the socialist bulwark. Even if the people are not prepared politically and ideologically, socialism cannot collapse when the army stands true to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The way of defending the ideological fortress of socialism is to make the revolutionary army an army strong in ideology and faith above all and arm the entire people with the socialist idea on this basis. Only then, can the ideological fortress be cemented as firm as a rock.      The WPK's policy of giving priority to the army is an invincible policy that always ensures victory in the military confrontation with imperialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The military confrontation is a life-and-death fight decisive of whether to become an independent people or colonial slaves of imperialism.   It is the way of defending the destiny of the country and the nation to counter strength with strength and arrogant use of arms with merciless strikes.   The WPK's policy of giving priority to the army is a powerful policy that ensures a decisive victory in political and diplomatic confrontation with imperialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The stand a revolutionary party and people should always maintain in the political and diplomatic confrontation with imperialism is a hard-line attitude of defending the fundamental interests of the revolution without any concession. A step of concession in diplomacy with vicious imperialism means continued concession in future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the WPK's policy of giving priority  to the army is a guarantee for sure victory in diplomacy with the enemies. Our self-reliant defence capabilities, a result of scores of years of arduous efforts, instill great fear into the imperialists.     We will strongly counter imperialism while saying whatever we want to say in face of any threat and blackmail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    In the third part the article refers to the wise policy that ushers in a new age of prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK's policy of giving priority to the army is greatly instrumental in laying a firm foundation of socialist society, the article says, and goes on:   As  the great leader Kim Jong Il said, the unity of the army and the people in ideology and fighting spirit based on the revolutionary spirit of soldiers is the  very essence of the idea of the army-people unity and the foundation of our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to lay the most solid foundation of socialist society, the army and the people should unite around the party in one mind. The army and the people are a pedestal propping up socialist society and the two major forces defending socialism.   It is thanks to Kim Jong Il's policy of giving priority to the army that the army-people unity has reached a remarkably high level in Korea today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary spirit of soldiers and the spirit of  devotedly defending the leader which were created in the army are now being followed by all the people. The army's style of work and fighting spirit, morality and culture are prevailing in the society. The army and the people love and assist each other and the  unity in ideology and fighting spirit exists between them. This is a real picture of our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The policy of giving priority to the army is a sure guarantee for steadily consolidating and developing the socialist government.   Government is a key means of enforcing politics while the army is a key means of defending the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK's  policy of giving priority to the army is a motive force to effect a fresh upsurge in socialist construction.   Strong  armed forces will guarantee peaceful conditions for economic construction.  The revolutionary army carries  out difficult tasks in socialist construction and arouses the people to heroic feats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will in the future, too, decisively  frustrate  the enemies' fictions of \"crisis\" and \"bankruptcy\" of the Korean-style socialism   with  the revolutionary line  of giving priority  to the army and rapidly  develop the national economy with a high pride.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In its fourth part the article stresses that the Korean revolution will emerge victorious at all times  thanks to the policy of giving priority to the army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article goes on:   The credit for the enduring vitality of the WPK's policy of giving priority to the army goes to the outstanding quality of the leader.\r\n   The respected leader Kim Jong Il has been recognized as a supreme model of statesman of brilliant commander type who is badly needed by the present era.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is none other than Kim Jong Il who is possessed of high political awareness,  extraordinary military wisdom, outstanding organizational  ability and commanding art of  encouraging the whole party, the whole army and all the people to act as one, matchless courage and  determination as well as exhaustive knowledge of all fields including politics and military affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This policy represents a great revolutionary leadership method clearly expressive of the outstanding greatness of Kim Jong Il as well as unique Kim Jong Il-style political method that should be named only after him.   Unshakable and enduring is the resolution of Kim Jong Il to carry to completion with arms the revolutionary cause of Juche, which was  pioneered with arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should invariably pursue the revolutionary line of giving priority to the army, taking it as a strategic line of the Korean revolution. \r\n\r\n"

A revolutionary system of leadership over the army and military discipline have been established throughout the army. The KPA is equipped with attack and defence means.   The WPK's policy of giving priority to the army is a guarantee for sure victory in diplomacy with the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOur self-reliant defence capabilities, which have been�@created in scores of years of arduous effort, instill great fear into the hearts of the imperialists.

He authored and published  more than 890 important works in 30 years from June, Juche 53 (1964) to June, Juche 83 (1994). \r\n   This means he published an annual average of 30 works and theses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Typical of them is the celebrated work \"On the Juche Idea\" (March 1982)  which fully reflects his political idea and method.   In the work, he raised the fundamentals of philosophy with the people as a center on a fresh basis and advanced a unique and revolutionary philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and decides everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work gives unique definitions to the socio-historical outlook with the position and role of the popular masses as the main and the principle and method  of guidance in the revolution and construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    He further developed and enriched the Juche idea in \"On Some Problems of Education in the Juche Idea\" (July 1986), \"On Having a Correct Viewpoint and Understanding of the Juche Philosophy\" (October 1990), \"On Establishing the Juche Outlook on the Revolution\" (October 1987) and other works.
