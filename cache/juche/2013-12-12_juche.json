Korean Authorities' Moves to Introduce Latest War Hardware\r\n Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released information bulletin No. 1056 on Thursday rapping the ever-more desperate moves of the south Korean puppet authorities to introduce latest war hardware.\n\t\t\t\t\t The information bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are mulling spending a stupendous amount of fund to introduce latest U.S.-made war hardware including F-35A, Global Hawk, CH-47D and various type missiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, they are contemplating massively introducing latest war hardware such as long-range air-to-ground guided missiles and reconnaissance planes from Germany, France and other countries in the wake of deployment of hundreds of precision guided missile Spike from Israel. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said actions are sparking  off deep concern and denunciation at home and abroad as they are reckless moves to escalate military confrontation and arms race on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia and aggravate the regional situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those moves of the south Korean regime are pursuant to the scenario of the U.S. to put it under its tighter military control and use it as a shock brigade for carrying out its Asian strategy and, at the same time,  amount to yielding to the U.S. pressure for buying more war hardware. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly indicate that the U.S. and south Korean puppet authorities are the arch criminals disturbing peace and security on the peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are making desperate efforts to make up for their inferiority by dint of superiority in technical equipment, taken aback by the tremendous military muscle of the DPRK. However, this is as foolish an act as precipitating their self-destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK will never pardon the moves of the puppet group to escalate the military confrontation and resolutely foil them with the might of Songun."

            "content": "S. Korean Ruling Forces Accused of Escalating Confrontation: News Analyst\r\n Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The present ruling forces of south Korea have kicked up a whirlwind of confrontation with the DPRK unprecedented in history under the signboard of \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" since they came to power.\n\t\t\t\t\tThey have tried hard to cover up the confrontation policy craftier than Lee Myung Bak's \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" with the veil of \"confidence.\" They have committed too many crimes against the DPRK to enumerate in the first year of their office under this signboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group has rushed headlong into escalating the confrontation since their seizure of power, saying that the \"confidence-building process\" would bring about progress in the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though six rounds of working-level talks between the authorities of the north and the south took place for resuming the operation in the Kaesong Industrial Zone, the puppet group disturbed them in every way, rendering them fruitless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the north and the south agreed to open their authorities' talks in Seoul, the puppet group put a brake on the issue of opening them over the matter of chief delegate, making them abortive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the situation on the Korean Peninsula was put on an orbit of detente and the inter-Korean relations were in the process of mending thanks to the positive efforts made by the DPRK, the puppet group let loose such provocative remarks that all those successes were ascribable to its \"confidence-building process\" and its \"principled policy towards the north\" was pulling the north. Consequently, the working-level talks between authorities of the north and the south for arranging the reunion of separated families and relatives and resuming the tour of Mt. Kumgang were indefinitely put off. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with opposing dialogue with the DPRK, the group made no scruple of denying the agreements already reached between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime's frantic confrontation of social systems has reached an alarming phase while its smear campaign against the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK has gone beyond a tolerance limit under the signboard of \"confidence.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It invited riff-raffs from the U.S. and its neighboring countries styling themselves experts to Seoul and let them say volumes about \"possibility of the north's collapse.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It, at the same time, desperately perpetrated such human rights abuses as conducting operations to allure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has conducted a ceaseless smear campaign against the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has brought an unprecedentedly great danger of a nuclear war to this land under the signboard of \"confidence\" policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after it took office, the regime worked out such a document for aggression as the \"joint plan for coping with the provocation of a local war\" to be followed by a \"strategy for annihilating the north's army\" through massive missile strikes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In October last alone, the south Korean warmongers staged ceaseless military drills in the East, West and South Seas of Korea with a nuclear carrier of the U.S. imperialists involved. They staged joint air logistic drills with U.S. forces for the first time and the largest-ever \"Max Thunder\" drill with the U.S. air force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  What merits attention is that the puppet forces have intensified their joint military drills with the Japan \"Self-defense Forces\" unprecedented in their history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Troops of the SDF conducted together with south Korean forces naval drills in the waters southeast of Jeju Island in May. They also staged large-scale joint naval strike maneuvers in the South Sea of Korea in October.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the puppet group of south Korea has put spurs to bolstering up its preemptive strike forces as evidenced by its hectic moves to import various types of missiles, warships, reconnaissance drones, bombs for destroying underground bunkers and air tankers. All these facts go to prove that its moves for a nuclear war have reached a more reckless phase in the past one year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling forces would be well advised to stop going reckless if they do not want to meet the same miserable end as that of the preceding dictators."

This is proved by what happened in Iraq. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once Iraq stood firm against the U.S. However, when the Persian Gulf War started, Iraq began stepping back, taken aback by the U.S. indiscriminate military attacks and bullying tactics. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the war, the U.S. had continued air raids and harsh sanctions for more than a decade, pressurizing Iraq to disarm and surrender.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Iraq could not but meet the U.S. demands, deterred by the U.S. arms and pressure. The Iraqi leadership accepted the forced inspection of military installations including major facilities of the country as demanded by the U.S. In the end, Iraq allowed the inspection of even the presidential palace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By doing so, Iraq tried to escape the U.S. imperialists' invasion and maintain power. But it was a serious miscalculation. The more concessions Iraq made, the greater ones Washington pushed for. It used to put military pressure on Iraq when the latter failed to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finally in 2003 the U.S. easily toppled the Sadam regime through an invasion against Iraq which was weakened by many years of sanctions and air raids. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same can be said of Libya. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Victory in the struggle for independence and progress is in store for the country and nation standing firm against the enemies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is proved by the history of the Korean people's struggle."

De esta manera, dio el ataque decisivo a los peligrosos actos fraccionalistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs inevitable la eliminacion de los fraccionalistas de version moderna. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl fraccionalismo es el enemigo de la revolucion que trae la division. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el inicio, la revolucion coreana vino avanzando en medio de la lucha intransigente contra los fraccionalistas que carcomen la unidad de las filas revolucionarias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo hay lugar donde vivir de parasito los fraccionalistas y los ambiciosos politicos en una nueva era de la revolucion jucheana en que todos los militares y civiles coreanos unidos compactamente en torno al gran dirigente marchan a galopes hacia el futuro radiante de un Estado prospero socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pueblo coreano confio solo al Presidente Kim Il Sung en el periodo de  la pasada Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria y de posguerra frustrando los actos antipartidistas de los fraccionalistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY en el periodo de la marcha penosa, la forzada tambien supero todas las pruebas con la firme conviccion de que vendra  sin falta el dia de la victoria bajo la guia del Dirigente Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las decadas del siglo pasado dio el golpe demoledor a los fraccionalistas antipartidistas y contrarrevolucionarios y vino consolidando por todos los medios la unidad monolitica cantando la cancion \"Levantemos en alto la bandera roja\" despues del fallecimiento del Presidente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, los integrantes de la tercera y cuarta generacion de la revolucion continuan la tradicion de la unidad monolitica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a tener al gran sucesor, continua sin vacilacion la causa revolucionaria del Juche iniciada en el monte Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa unidad monolitica es lo mas importante de la revolucion jucheana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de eliminar a los fraccionalistas que se oponian al partido, la revolucion, la patria y el pueblo, se ha purificado y consolidado mil veces la unidad monolitica de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs invencible la unidad monolitica del partido, el ejercito y el pueblo en torno al lider basada en la unica idea y voluntad."

Pero, una vez iniciada la guerra del golfo persico, comenzo a retroceder por el pavor al indiscriminado ataque militar y fanfarroneria del imperio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de terminada la guerra del golfo, EE.UU. practico durante mas de 10 anos el ataque aereo y la sancion brutal contra Iraq demandandole rendirse desarmado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDoblegada ante la fuerza y la presion de EE.UU., la Direccion de Iraq se vio obligada a permitir la inspeccion forzada de los objetos militares incluso las instalaciones importantes del pais y hasta el Palacio Presidencial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, Iraq intento eludir la invasion armada norteamericana y mantener el poder. Pero, esto fue una gran equivocacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que Iraq hacia alguna concesion, EE.UU. le pedia la otra mas grande en compania de presion militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor fin, en 2003, el imperio cometio la invasion armada al pais persico, debilitado tanto por la sancion y ataque aereo de varios anos, y derroco facilmente el poder de Sadam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSucedio lo mismo en el caso de Libia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa victoria en la lucha por la independencia y el progreso esta al lado del pais y la nacion que luchan con intransigencia contra los enemigos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo comprueba la historia de lucha del pueblo coreano."
