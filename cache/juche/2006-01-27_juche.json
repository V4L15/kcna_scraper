It is also important to expand the area under high-yielding potato, take thorough-going measures to prevent epidemics, select right soil for double-cropping and provide meticulous technological guidance and ensure a high yield of before and after crops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is required to implement the Party's policy to develop agriculture in combination with stock-breeding so as to solve both the food and meat problems. Greater quantity of compost should be applied to paddy and non-paddy fields to decisively increase the soil fertility.\r\n Waterway projects and land realignment should be pushed forward without let-up in different areas including the Miru Plain, land management be improved, mechanization and the use of chemicals be stepped up and various types of more efficient farm machines and greater quantities of fertilizers be produced and supplied to the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More rapes should be cultivated as the first crop so as to consistently push forward the work to solve the problem of cooking oil and efforts be made to boost the agricultural production as a whole including vegetable, cash crops, stock-breeding, fruit-growing and sericulture.\r\n It is necessary for the field of agricultural scientific research to successfully solve scientific and technological problems arising in implementing the Party's policy of agricultural revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter underlined the need for the agricultural field to direct to the grain production as many rural labor forces as possible and concentrate all machines, equipment and materials on farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made at the meeting.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They made not only the DPRK but big powers targets of their preemptive nuclear assault. The struggle for protecting peace from war would be unthinkable without an anti-U.S. struggle. \r\n What is important in the anti-U.S. struggle is to discard fear of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to heighten vigilance against the moves of the U.S. allies for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has emerged a dangerous force of aggression in Asia, backed by the United States. Israel is now contemplating an attack on nuclear facilities in Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the imperialist allied forces are seeking tightened alliance and working hard to divide and alienate other countries, all the peace-loving countries and people are called upon to unite as one under the banner of peace against war in order to avert a war and defend peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also important to build up one's own force in the struggle for peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The experience gained by the DPRK in practice goes to prove that only when a country bolsters its self-reliant defence force on a priority basis by attaching importance to military affairs and tightening the belt can it avert a war and defend its sovereignty and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will hold the banner of Songun high this year, too, and thus frustrate the moves of the U.S. imperialists for a new war and defend peace on the Korean Peninsula. They will closely unite with the world anti-imperialist independent forces and steadily wage the movement for peace against war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The danger of a war of aggression in Korea is always posed by outsiders.\r\n As far as the issue of war and peace is concerned, the north and the south are a community linked with the same destiny. \r\n They should go united to foil the U.S. imperialists' moves to ignite a new war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Holding that the arms buildup and exercises for a war of aggression against the north that threaten the fellow countrymen should be halted unconditionally, the appeal called for waging a more dynamic struggle to force the U.S. troops, a harasser of peace and the root cause of war, to quit the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces' seizure of power in south Korea is little short of igniting a train of a nuclear war, the appeal said, calling on the south Koreans from all walks of life that love peace to resolutely frustrate this group's plot to usurp power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also underscored the need to strengthen the June 15 Joint National Committee, a nationwide solidarity organization for reunification, so that it may increase its function and role as a central body for national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"National Security Law\" in south Korea is a stumbling block lying in the way of great national unity, the appeal pointed out, calling for pulling down the last barriers in the era of the confrontation including the NSL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It earnestly called on all the Koreans to set this year as a year of the three-point patriotic movement and come out as one in the struggle to attain its goal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
