            "content": "Japan Urged to Settle Its Crimes Committed against Korean Nation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 17 (KCNA) -- We will always remember the grudge-bearing history in which Japan tried to exterminate all Koreans in the past and surely force Japan to pay for the crimes committed against them for a century. \r\nThe DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to Comfort Women for the Japanese Army and the Victims of Forcible Drafting said this in a statement on Nov. 16 a century since the \"1905 Five-Point Treaty\" was fabricated by the Japanese imperialists to realize their brigandish ambition to invade Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement went on: This forged treaty reduced the Korean nation to a stateless one. The Koreans were fated either to obey the Japanese law or die under the 40 odd year-long colonial fascist rule of the Japanese imperialists characterized by brutal political and ideological suppression, plunder of properties and moves to exterminate the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their colonial rule over Korea was a hideous criminal act to remove Korea from the surface of the earth to realize their wild dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the widely accepted practice for an assailant to reflect on its crime and compensate to the victim in the light of international relations and the relationship between individuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Already at the time when the \"1905 Five-Point Treaty\" was concluded under coercion and announced the background against which the treaty was cooked up, its hypocrisy and its violation of international law were undisputably recognized at home and abroad. However, Japan is now talking about \"legality\" and \"legitimacy\" in a bid to justify its aggression of Korea and its crimes committed against humanity and teach the younger generation grossly distorted history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to Comfort Women for the Japanese Army and the Victims of Forcible Drafting will probe all the hideous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people to the letter and record them in history. It will stage a more dynamic movement demanding Japan liquidate its past until its government admits its crimes perpetrated in the past, apologize and compensate to the Korean people for them.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

It is duty-bound to honestly apologize and adequately compensate to them. Rodong Sinmun Thursday demands this in a signed commentary. \r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the issue of compensating for the damage done by the U.S. forces in south Korea in a firing range in Maehyang-ri its side claimed that it is not responsible for it and, therefore, it can not pay the indemnity. This once again shows what arrogant and brazen-faced group of robbers they are.\r\n The issue of compensation for the damage done by the firing range surfaced because the U.S. imperialist aggression troops inflicted unspeakable misfortune and disaster upon the inhabitants by staging madcap war exercises against the north almost every day for the last decades after building a huge drill ground for their air force. In this regard the Supreme Court of south Korea officially admitted in March last year the damage done to the population of Maehyang-ri by bombing and firing exercises by the U.S. air force and ruled that the authorities should compensate for it and this has already been carried out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the \"south Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement\", the south Korean authorities should pay indemnity first and the U.S. forces side should cover 75 percent of it later. The U.S. forces in south Korea, however, have turned down the south Korean authorities' request for sharing the payment of indemnity, blustering that they can not admit the claim and have no responsibility to pay indemnity. This is an intolerable insult and a mockery of the south Koreans as it is an arrogant high-handed practice of the occupation forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans are called upon to scrap all humiliating and traitorous treaties and agreements and wage a more dynamic struggle to force the U.S. forces to quit south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on:\r\n 100 years have passed since the illegal document for aggression was faked up on Nov. 17, 1905. Japan, however, is vociferating about the \"lawfulness\" and \"legitimacy\" of the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"treaty\" was a false document faked up by the Japanese imperialists by threatening and blackmailing the king, the supreme representative of the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty, and its ministers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was an illegal false document without any form as a treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe treaty should have a form as a treaty according to the usage under international law and go through procedures such as the authorization given to the representative, the adoption of the treaty according to the free will of the representatives and ratification by the supreme representative. But the \"1905 Five-point Treaty\" could not be recognized by international law as it completely lacked any form as a treaty; it had no title, signature of the king, state seal and letter of attorney for the representative, important elements for the effectuation of the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea was put under the military occupation and rule of the Japanese imperialists by the force of the treaty. The Japanese imperialists enforced the colonial rule over Korea, occupying it for over 40 years, and inflicted unspeakable misfortune, sufferings and mental and material damage upon the Korean people by the force of the above-said illegal and invalid treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists fabricated the treaty in such a brigandish manner and forced the Korean nation into colonial slavery for nearly half a century. This crime can never be concealed nor erased no matter how much water may flow under the bridge.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a challenge to the history and an intolerable mockery of the Korean nation who was forced to undergo sufferings due to Japan.\r\n We will certainly force Japan to apologize and compensate for the damage it did to the Koreans for the past more than four decades and will never overlook its moves to emerge a military power, obsessed by the ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still fresh in our memory is the secret Taft-Katsura agreement signed on July 29, 1905 that served as a basis for the fabrication of the \"1905 Five-point Treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The disgraceful history in which the Korean nation's fate was ruthlessly decided by the agreement signed at the confab among powers seeking supremacy should never be allowed to repeat itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans should foil all sorts of ceaseless high-handed practices and meet all challenges by those states and carve out their destiny by themselves.\r\n All the Koreans will wage a dynamic nationwide movement to force Japan to pay for its shameful past by their concerted efforts and wrest apology and compensation from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will unite closer in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, escalate the nationwide movement for national reconciliation, unity and reunification and take resolute joint actions to make Japan settle its wrongs perpetrated in the past and at present and foil its moves to revive militarism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
