It continues:\r\n The new, fair international order can be established only through a struggle to meet the vicious challenge of the dominationist forces, forces opposed to independence.\r\n What is most important in the efforts to build a fair international order is to respect the sovereignty of each country and nation. Non-interference in other countries' internal affairs is important for the respect for sovereignty. This interference constitutes a blatant infringement upon sovereignty. If it is allowed and encouraged, the world will be divided into the dominating countries and those under domination and the relationship among countries will turn into that of antagonism and confrontation, domination and subordination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists should not be allowed to infringe upon other countries' sovereignty. All people should not have any illusion or expectation towards imperialism but wage an uncompromising struggle against it, keenly aware that the aggressive and predatory nature of the imperialists will never change. It is of particular necessity to build up military muscle to resolutely counter the imperialists' high-handed practices. The sovereignty of a country should be protected by its own force. No force on earth can match the people who are militarily strong enough to defend themselves and firm in their determination to defeat any aggressors to protect the sovereignty of their country by their own force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is also important for building a new, fair international order is to maintain the principle of equality and impartiality. It is essential for abiding by the principle of equality and impartiality in international relations not to permit any high-handed, arbitrary and unilateral practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Double standards should be rejected in order to observe the principle of equality and impartiality in the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article underscores the need for the non-aligned and other developing countries to achieve international solidarity so as to build a new, fair international order.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
