Korean Warmongers: NDC Policy Department \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- The south Korean warmongers have recently resorted to such military provocation of infiltrating warships deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK near the five islands in the West Sea of Korea almost every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t They even opened fire at civilian fishing boats of other country, pushing the situation to the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with this, Park Geun Hye who declared her presidential candidacy has gone so impudent as to call for maintaining the \"northern limit line\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tensions created in the West Sea of Korea and the ill-boding movements of the south Korean conservative politicians arouse big concerns and fear inside and outside Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea gave following answers to the questions raised by KCNA Saturday as regards the prevailing situation: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the Southwestern Front Command of the Korean People's Army warned in the strong terms, the south Korean puppet military warmongers' reckless military provocations have created a touch-and-go situation in the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean navy warships have intruded into the territorial waters of the DPRK at the instigation of the U.S. master and such an act has long gone beyond the tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn recent days they opened fire without prior warnings at peaceful fishing boats of other country though they were aware of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors and military warmongers of south Korea are trying to justify all these frantic actions as measures for defending the \"northern limit line\" and Park Geun Hye and other ambitious politicians are using them for stepping up the presidential campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known by the world, military conflicts and acute standoff have persisted in the West Sea of Korea and the region has turned into the biggest hotspot. This is wholly attributable to the brigandish moves of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces to defend the \"northern limit line\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"northern limit line\" is the illegal, ghostlike line which was drawn in the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces which occupied south Korea under the helmet of the \"UN Forces\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their acts remind one of a gangster who stretched a rotten straw rope in other's yard without knowledge of the owner and insists that it is his own yard.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their insistence on the line, therefore, is just sophism to justify their violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and invasion of its territory, and an open action of aggression to hurt the national defence and security of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the very reason why the DPRK has so far maintained its invariable stand on the \"northern limit line\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe issue of undertaking joint fishing and setting up peaceful waters in the West Sea of Korea clarified in the historic October 4 declaration is one of the measures taken under the north-south agreement on the premise that \"the northern limit line\" is illegal to all intents and purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye's assertion that she would discuss the issue agreed upon in the October 4 declaration on the premise of \"respecting the northern limit line\" and outbursts let loose by puppet government authorities in defence of the line are nothing but an expression of ignorance of the background against which the north-south joint agreement was signed and its contents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever truly wants peace on the Korean Peninsula, not a war, should not go such reckless as working hard to preserve the \"northern limit line.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going against this stark need of the era, such \"yusin\" remnants as Park Geun Hye in the south Korean political camp are working hard in every way to seize power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The call for preserving the \"northern limit line\" cannot be construed otherwise than a declaration of confrontation and a war drumbeat aimed to turn the West Sea of Korea into a theatre for escalating the confrontation with compatriots and cause the repetition of the Yonphyong Island shelling incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and the people of the DPRK will thoroughly foil any attempt to turn the West Sea of Korea into a theatre of confrontation, conflict and a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces should not forget even a moment that the operational group on the southwestern front of the DPRK is highly alerted on the eve of storm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their desperate efforts to preserve the illegal \"northern limit line\" will bring only death to them."

The Lee regime carried out the drill of preempting an attack on the DPRK and the \"north stabilization operation\" which puts to action the \"administrative power\" in the northern half of Korea during the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drills even though it loudly claimed that they are of \"defensive\" nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the PSI drill of the U.S. and the south Korean regime is targeted against the DPRK. When cooking up the PSI in 2003 the U.S. called it another arrow in the quiver targeting north Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the Lee regime drew into the drill warships of the Japan \"Self-defence Forces\" which are whetting the sword of reinvasion. South Korea is at odds with Japan over Tok Islets issue but they cooperate with each other in escalating the stand-off with the DPRK. This proves that the Lee regime is working with bloodshot eyes to join hands with foreign forces and realize its ambition for invasion of the DPRK with their help at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Lee regime of traitors encroaches upon even a bit the sovereignty of the DPRK, it will never miss the chance but mercilessly wipe out the provokers."

What he uttered is nothing but outbursts made by the worst confrontation maniac and last-ditch effort of an old man more dead than alive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee turned the \"National Assembly\" of south Korea into mayhem as it is forsaken by the people and a platform for wrangle between the ruling and opposite parties and among different factions. He, however, spoke ill of the session of the SPA of the DPRK held in a splendid and dignified atmosphere. It was highly ridiculous. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, the 6th Session of the 12th SPA of the DPRK promulgated the Law on Enforcing the Universal 12-year Compulsory Education. This marked a great event in the efforts of the Korean people for the socialist construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK have always set the education as one of the basic issues decisive of the rise and fall of the country and future destiny of the nation and spared nothing for the education of the younger generation even under hard conditions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK emerged a dignified military power possessed of nuclear deterrence, a producer and launcher of satellites and turned into a great country with the Juche-oriented and modern heavy and light industrial bases. This is the shining fruition of the peerlessly great men's noble outlook on the younger generation and future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The universal 12-year compulsory education is a great bold decision prompted by the steadfast will of the WPK and the DPRK government to build a thriving socialist nation by raising the quality of education in line with the requirements of the era and the developing revolution for pushing back the frontiers of latest science and technology on the basis of the great successes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a great turn in building a highly civilized state in name and reality to provide legal, material and social environment for increasing the might of the power of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why all Koreans in the north, south and overseas and world people fully support and praise the enforcement of the universal 12-year compulsory education in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than Lee Myung Bak who threw the people of south Korea into dire destitution and reduced education to bankruptcy through his sycophancy towards the U.S., unpopular policy and fascist dictatorship. What he uttered about \"people's living\" in the DPRK is nothing but hysteric jargon by a lunatic utterly ignorant of where he stands. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee is no more than the most disgusting rat-like and crazy man utterly ignorant of what is going on in the world stuck in the back room of Chongwadae. He is not aware of what miserable end he is fated to meet for having turned south Korean society into a dark one without any future and the \"Pandora's box\" of modern version. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee is so preoccupied with amassing illicit money in a dark den that he can neither understand nor estimate the great outlook the WPK and the DPRK government on the younger generation and its inexhaustible might. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His reckless remarks about the agenda item of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly are nothing but the last-ditch effort made by him, much upset by the fact that world attention is focused on the leaping progress made in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group of traitors can never bar the DPRK from making a dynamic advance towards the most civilized thriving socialist nation."
