            "content": "U.S. Forces' Bombing of Tok Islet and Mass Killing of Civilians under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the press corps of the south Korean KBS disclosed the fact that a civic organization of Ullung Island found out concrete evidence including bomb splinters and unexploded bombs which proved the fact that the United States used Tok Islet as a bombing drill ground of its air force right after August 15 liberation of Korea. Among other things it told the shocking story that on June 9, 1948 a U.S. bomber appeared in the sky above Tok Islet and indiscriminately dropped bombs over the islet as well as on fishing boats at work in the waters near it, killing many fishermen.\r\n A spokesman for the North Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Crimes issued a statement on Friday in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said the killing of at least 300 civilians by indiscriminately bombing Tok Islet in peace time, not in the wartime, was thrice-cursed barbarism which could be committed only by beast-like U.S. troops and a deliberate mass killing of Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days the U.S. forces side justified itself by claiming that the bomber wrongly bombed fishing boats after taking them for rocks, and the U.S. and the south Korean authorities have tried to conceal the case though nearly 60 years have passed since then, far from making an investigation into the number of casualties caused by the bombing and other aspects of the massacre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bombing of Tok Islet and mass killing of civilians are triggering off bitter resentment among all the Koreans as they provide more clear evidence proving the U.S. brutalities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 60 odd year-long-history of the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is, in the true sense of the word, a history of the most barbarous massacres aimed at exterminating the Korean nation and a history of brigandish aggression by warmongers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can never escape misfortune and sufferings nor can the Korean nation get rid of war disasters as long as the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces stay in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and the south Korean authorities should probe the truth about the above-said cases, make an apology and punish those responsible for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korean people from all walks of life should turn out as one in the struggle to get the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces, the root cause of all misfortune and sufferings, withdrawn from south Korea at an early date and regain the usurped dignity and sovereignty of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Very busy as he was with the Songun revolutionary leadership, he radically changed the country's appearance to meet the need of socialism and has energetically led the land management, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They gave detailed accounts of the facts that a high-pitched drive for the general mobilization for land administration was under way across the country to bring about an unprecedented surge in the work and world startling miracles and innovations were reported from every part of the country, a clear proof of its justice and vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gigantic changes made over the last decade are the brilliant fruition of Kim Jong Il's Juche-oriented idea of the general mobilization for land administration and his wise leadership, they pointed out, stressing that these undying exploits will go down to posterity with the history of building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers underscored the need to continue energetically pushing forward the land management for turning the country into a socialist land of bliss in order to carry out the important tasks proposed in the work.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article Friday.\r\n To achieve the independent reunification of the country by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation is the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and the invariable and steadfast will of the nation no matter how situation and circumstance may change, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"By our nation itself\" is the common idea of the nation for independent reunification and the patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity is the struggle to put the idea into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for independent reunification serves as the direct application and practice of the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as it is the patriotic movement to reunify the country independently by the Korean nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence is the core of settlement of the issue of national reunification, and reunification related to the destiny of the fellow countrymen is unthinkable without this principle. Korea should be reunified by the Korean nation itself without interference of any outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for peace against war is one to pool the efforts of the Korean nation to oppose the war moves of foreign forces and defend peace of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for peace against war today is one to build up the structure of confrontation between the whole Korean nation and the United States and one to win victory in the confrontation. The aggression and war moves of the U.S. imperialists cannot be smashed successfully without applying the idea of independence and unity such as \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The essential content of the patriotic movement for great national unity is to apply the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"By our nation itself\" is the idea of great unity whose basic content and prerequisite are the unity of the nation. The idea of \"By our nation itself\" is unthinkable and its application cannot be discussed apart from the unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic key to applying the idea is to achieve great national unity.  If all the fellow countrymen firmly defend and apply the idea of \"By our nation itself\", they can certainly achieve independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
