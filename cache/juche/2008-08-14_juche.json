Paektu and the roots of the shining victories and successes achieved in the past 8 decade-long revolutionary struggle in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideas and theories on the education in loyalty clarified by Kim Jong Il in the work serve as highly important guidelines to be always held fast to in fully preparing officials as vanguard fighters devotedly defending the leader, firmly equipped with the revolutionary outlook on the leader and a great banner for consolidating the single-minded unity of the party and revolutionary ranks, they noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the past two decades the ideas and theories on establishing a revolutionary outlook on the leader have fully displayed validity and vitality with their tremendous attraction and dynamism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were Kim Jung Rin, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Yong Jin, minister of Education, officials of party and administrative bodies and working people's organizations at national level and in Pyongyang, officials of scientific, educational, literary and art and media institutions and party cadre-training institutions and those in the field of preservation of revolutionary relics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This revolutionary optimism of the anti-Japanese forerunners stroke terror into the heart of the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung writes in his reminiscences \"With the Century\": The veterans of the anti-Japanese revolution fought to make history, rather than leave their names in history. �c If we had taken up arms to leave our names in history, we would have been unable to achieve a great historical success, now known as the history of the anti-Japanese revolution by the present generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today, the third and fourth generations of the Korean revolution are striving harder to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche with the indomitable spirit of the anti-Japanese martyrs as their ideological and mental pillar.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, single-mindedly united around General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strong mental power of the Korean people who have decorated annals of the revolution with the undying heroic epic under the leadership of the party and the leader is based on the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu, the editorial says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the epoch-making victories and successes achieved in the Korean revolution and construction would have been unthinkable without the charging spirit, the indomitable fighting spirit and the spirit of independence, the spirit the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners fully displayed to break through any ordeals, fight it out and liberate the country and build a socialist paradise by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victories won by the Korean people in the two grim revolutionary wars were military miracles brought by the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu, and this spirit was source of the stamina of Chollima whereby the powerful socialist country, independent in politics, self-sufficient in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, was built on the ruins. The revolutionary soldier spirit and the Kanggye spirit, created in the period of \"Arduous March\" and forced march, were also a brilliant embodiment of the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When we fight in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu we can defeat any formidable enemy and there will be neither hardships nor fortress impossible for us to overcome or conquer. This is the historical review of the Korean revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu is the everlasting spirit of Korea and the Korean people are men of mental power who have armed themselves with this spirit under the leadership of the great party. The Korean revolution's mainstay of ideology and spirit remains unchanged though there was the change of generations and centuries. The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu serves as an invariable ideological and moral pillar of the Korean people forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the party members and other working people should hold fast to this spirit as an ever-victorious treasured sword and conduct a vigorous offensive to reach the high peak of the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and thus demonstrate all over the world the mettle of the heroic people who have grown to be men of ideology and faith under the care of President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il, the editorial concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is obviously nothing but a vicious and mean move to destroy and stifle Chongryon, a legitimate organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their brutal suppression of Chongryon is a crime diametrically running counter to international law and humanitarian norms and principles, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By intensifying this suppression they seek to retrieve the Japanese imperialists' defeat and evade the responsibility to redress their past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are becoming frantic in their moves to suppress and destroy Chongryon by bringing groundless charges against it and mobilizing even state power, while shelving the issue of liquidating Japan's past crimes, a key issue concerning the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon and Koreans in Japan have struggled to protect their national identity and interests and democratic rights, subject to national discrimination in Japan. The Japanese reactionaries' hysteric crackdown upon them is a serious human rights abuse contrary to the human ethics and morality and the spirit of humanitarianism and a rash act of infringing upon and mocking at the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the Japanese reactionaries justify their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves. They are unpardonable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their desperate efforts to do harm to the DPRK and Chongryon would only rapidly heighten the hatred of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK against Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to bear this in mind and stop at once the anti-Chongryon, anti-DPRK hysteria which only pushes the situation to a grave phase.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is intended to prepare the SDF in such a way as to get it capable of coping with any modern war and play an important role in igniting a war of aggression overseas any time and executing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries through this is to rapidly convert the SDF which was organized and systematized to serve the purpose of the so-called \"defence\" according to the principle of \"exclusive defence\" into armed forces for mounting preemptive attacks in a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This move is posing a grave threat to the peace in Asia and the rest of the world and further straining the situation in the vicinity of Japan, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is rushing headlong into militarism and made the DPRK the primary target of its strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never remain an onlooker to the moves of the Japanese reactionaries posing a grave military threat to it, while whetting its sword to stage a comeback to Korea. It is following them with a high degree of vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan finally launches re-invasion despite the repeated warnings from the DPRK, it will give vent to the grudge against Japan pent up for more than a century and send the whole of Japan, a country of islands, into the bottom of the sea. This is the unanimous will and tough stand of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK to struggle against Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should learn the truth that this extraordinary readiness and will are guaranteed by full capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to halt such rash acts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Not content with this, they are putting sanctions and pressure upon these countries, charging them with ''drug trafficking,\" ''proliferation of WMDs'' and ''flesh traffic\" and the like. Through this they seek to isolate the above-said countries worldwide and set up \"governments serving them\" and thus realize their ambition to dominate the world. In a word, the imperialists' rackets of sanctions and pressure are a wanton infringement upon the sovereignty of the independent countries and a product of their sinister plot to realize the above-mentioned ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article cites facts to prove that the U.S. is now escalating its sanctions and pressure upon such sovereign countries as Myanmar, Syria, Belarus, Iran and Zimbabwe. This is censured and condemned by the world public for being an infringement upon the sovereignty of these countries and interference in their internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that neither sanctions nor pressure can be a solution to any problem, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
