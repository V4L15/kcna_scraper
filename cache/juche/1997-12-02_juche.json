Korea plagued with crimes\r\n    Pyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- The Seoul district court reportedly sentenced Han Kwang Il to five years' imprisonment.\r\n   Han Kwang Il was arrested on the charge of penetrating into a hotel in Seoul on October 5 and stabbing a hotel employee with a dagger to rob her of money, inflicting a severe injury upon her.\r\n   He fled to South Korea together with his elder brother in June 1993 after his violation of a law was brought to light in the northern half of Korea. He roamed about with no job for two years since then. He was arrested on charge of committing a robbery in July last and arrested again in September one month after his release.\r\n   According to data published by the puppets some time ago, those who defected to South Korea after committing crimes in the northern half of Korea are leading a wandering life with no job or are being thrown behind bars for robberies in the decadent South Korean society where money is almighty.\r\n   This is an inevitable product of such an anti-social system as South Korean society which is plagued with corruption and irregularities and all manner of social vices. It is also the tenor of the defectors' life.\r\n   Criminals and robbers hold sway in such a world.\r\n   South Korea is a lawless society where Kim Young Sam in power is engaged in flunkeyist treacheries, fascism and illicit accumulation of wealth and his son Kim Hyon Chol, a jobless man, committed all sorts of crimes with the backing of his father. \r\n   The puppet President of South Korea, \"National Assemblymen\" and ministers and lower-level civilian servants of the South Korean government are all engaging themselves in misappropriation of the taxes squeezed from the people, as well as all kinds of swindles.\r\n   All this is a sign of the ruining South Korean society.\r\n   The South Korean society will soon collapse with the worsening economic crisis and scramble for power among the political charlatans.    \r\n\r\n"
