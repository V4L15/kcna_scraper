Later he taught an orientation and ways of restoring the Puyong Temple, which was severely destroyed by an air raid of the U.S. imperialists, to its original state on the principle of historicism, they said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They noted that Kim Jong Il indicated a direction and ways of turning the area around the temple into a place for working people's cultural rest. \r\n Officials, builders and working people in the city turned out as one to carry out the behest of the President and instructions of Kim Jong Il and completed such difficult projects as an underwater groundwork for a pavilion in a pond and land levelling, thus successfully completing the restoration of the temple, they said.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n"

The remains of war criminals including Tojo who was prosecuted and sentenced to death at the Fareastern Military Tribunal have been secretly preserved in the shrine and politicians have visited it like stray cats. Now the visit to the shrine has been put on an organized and regular basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the Japanese chief executive who had been criticized for his visits to the shrine recently declared that he would continue to visit the shrine, touching off resentment and protest of the Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The visits to the shrine by Japanese cabinet members and dietmen and other politicians are a vivid expression of the strong tendency of the Japanese society to veer to the Right and the Japanese reactionaries' wild ambition for militarization and overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities and politicians never forget to pay lip-service to \"peace\" and \"international contribution\" in the international arena. But, in actuality, they are pursuing militarism and ultranationalism. This is little short of their intention to evade their responsibility to redress Japan's past and rush headlong into reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to behave itself, clearly mindful that its militarist reinvasion leads to its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

But it is the view of our relevant field on this matter that this has happened because the Congress delegation will have an opportunity to see for itself the nuclear facility in Nyongbyon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We wonder if the administration is not getting nervous about the possibility of the state of our nuclear activity being confirmed by the delegation. Is there any need to do so? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An action was taken to block even the visit of Congressmen though a formal agreement was reached with other country on its date.

Through this south Korea seeks to please the U.S. by joining in its moves of aggression and occupation to help it meet its greedy interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a revelation of the way of thinking depending on outsiders peculiar to south Korea bereft of national identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe hypocrisy of the authorities' talk about the \"state interests\" is clearly proved by the fact that they are trying to justify the decision with the veil of \"world peace\" and link it to the \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for south Korea to talk about peace while supporting and joining in the shameful war of aggression opposed by the world and rejected even by the UN. It is foolhardy for them to link the troop dispatch to the \"peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue\". It is illogical to support and join in the war of aggression launched by the outsiders to prevent a war to be launched by outsiders. The troop dispatch to Iraq would neither help ensure peace on the Korean peninsula nor protect the well-being of the nation. On the contrary, it would encourage the U.S. in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its moves to provoke a war against the country. The south Korean authorities should clearly understand that their dispatch of more troops to Iraq to support the outsiders in their acts of aggression will be a thrice-cursed traitorous act of fanning the U.S. war hysteria and its brigandish unilateralism and bringing a war to the Korean peninsula. If south Korea finally and additionally sends troops to Iraq it would be little short of repeating the disgraceful history in the past when it dispatched troops to Vietnam and adding to the crimes it committed against history and the nation in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the U.S. let the south Korean minister of National Defense and the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea, not responsible for the conclusion of the agreement, sign it, disregarding such procedure in order to avoid the trouble that might surface in the course of consultation. When there was a strong assertion within the south Korean \"government\" that the agreement was illegal and invalid as it bore no signature of the south Korean side's representative the U.S. instructed the deputy commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea to force Pan Ki Mun to sign the unilaterally drafted paper which said that he recognized the legality of the agreement in May 1991. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This U.S. arrogant act is touching off bitter indignation among the south Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They fought heroic battles against the imperialist aggressor forces in the same trenches with the Korean People's Army. The militant friendship and cooperative relations were fully demonstrated and consolidated between the two armies and peoples during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peoples of the two countries created the tradition of sharing feelings and helping each other during the common struggle against the Japanese imperialists and many Korean sons and daughters directly participated in the Chinese revolutionary civil war and performed heroic feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-China friendship, which has a long history and tradition, has grown stronger day after day despite ordeals and storms. And the history of this friendship is given steady continuity in the new century, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Chinese people are achieving successes in the dynamic drive to turn China into a modern socialist country, guided by the main idea of the \"three represents\", under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Hu Jintao as its general secretary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government to boost the friendship with China generation after generation. The long-standing DPRK-China friendship will grow stronger thanks to the joint efforts of the two parties, governments and peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in an article says that the feats performed by the martyrs of the CPV during the great Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people will shine forever together with the history of the daily developing DPRK-China friendship.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

She visited the DPRK earlier.\r\n This U.S. action compelled the DPRK to resume the nuclear program to meet the country's energy need, she said, adding that the Bush administration's assertion that the DPRK is going to attack the U.S. and other countries of the world does not stand to reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She introduced the reality in the DPRK, noting that the DPRK government is granting its people social benefits despite manifold difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the U.S. killed millions of Koreans in cold blood and reduced Korea into debris during the last Korean war and is now keen to launch a new war to invade the DPRK, she contended that but for the U.S. obstructions Korea would have long been reunified.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
