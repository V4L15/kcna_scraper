Some countries' access to nuclear weapons, therefore, presents itself as an issue of defending themselves from the U.S., among other things, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cannot but be a universally accepted and just logic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous desire and wish of humankind to live in the world completely free from nuclear weapons and the threat of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, there are on earth a very large number of nukes enough to destroy it more than a hundred times. This is very adversely affecting mankind's peace and development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the keynote of the U.S. strategy to establish world domination on the basis of its unchallenged nuclear position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear doctrine \"Those with nuclear weapons dominate the world\" still remains unchanged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., the first nuclear war criminal state that imposed a nuclear disaster upon humankind, has followed the road of large-scale buildup of nuclear forces and their expansion. About 20,000 nuclear warheads are stockpiled in the U.S. nuclear arsenal which are much more than the nuclear warheads of other nuclear weapons states put together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is putting spurs to beefing up modern nuclear forces, still regarding a preemptive nuclear strike as a main task of its military strategy in the 21st century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commander of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Command asserted that the U.S. Department of Defense should develop improved nuclear weapons as means to beat back attacks from other countries in the 21st century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The department recently kicked off the research into using SM-3 on the ground. The move to put SM-3 now aboard Aegis ships under a new system whereby they can be fired on the ground reveals part of the U.S. modernization of the nuclear weapons system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the U.S. spent at least 52.4 billion U.S. dollars for the development and modernization of nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the U.S. is pushing forward the modernization of nukes in real earnest by channeling a stupendous amount of funds into their development behind the scene of \"nuclear disarmament.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK, in particular, has steadily increased in the recent period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Walter Sharp, commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea, recently blustered that the U.S. would be firmly committed to providing a nuclear umbrella to south Korea, asserting that the \"U.S.-south Korea Mutual Defense Treaty\" would remain valid even after the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations\" to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. pressure upon the DPRK to dismantle its nukes, while talking about the \"provision of a nuclear umbrella to south Korea,\" is little short of forcing it to lay down arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was entirely just for the DPRK to have acquired nuclear deterrent for self-defence to cope with the ever-more undisguised moves of the U.S. for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those with nukes can be countered only in kind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is now compelled to take the road of a nuclear arms race due to the U.S. nuclear war moves whether it likes or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is self-evident that the U.S. national strategy should be changed as it was based on the conception that only the U.S. is allowed to boost its nuclear capability and other countries of the world can be pressurized not to manufacture such weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such practice of the U.S. as taking issue with others' nuclear deterrents, while pursuing its ambitious nuclear policy as it pleases, is bound to trigger off protest against its nuclear policy and spark off a global nuclear arms race.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a definite end is to be put to the nuclear arms race, the U.S., the world's biggest nuclear power, should rectify its nuclear policy as early as possible."

Korea Lambasted\r\n Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea recently let loose a spate of balderdash that the south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defense treaty\" will remain valid though the \"right to command wartime operations\" is transferred to south Korea and the \"U.S. is firmly committed to providing a nuclear umbrella\" to south Korea and the like. \n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: These outbursts were prompted by the U.S. desire to give a shot in the arm of the puppets running helter-skelter after being isolated internally and externally for frantically pursuing confrontation with fellow countrymen and, at the same time, dare to stifle the DPRK with military threat and blackmail against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He went the lengths of blustering that south Korea and the U.S. would maintain the posture of prompt combat actions on the basis of OPLAN 5027 and OPLAN 5029, talking about someone's \"emergency situation.\" These remarks cannot be interpreted otherwise than unpardonable bellicose outbursts hurting the supreme dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. call for \"maintaining the posture of prompt combat actions\" is little short of a declaration that it has rounded off its scenario for a nuclear war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits serious attention is that the puppets are zealously joining the U.S. in its reckless moves to ignite a nuclear war of aggression against the DPRK. This is evidenced by the fact that the puppets claimed that they are \"at the phase in which their counter proposal was put into a concrete plan.\" This is nothing but a reckless behavior to bring the inter-Korean relations to total collapse and do harm to compatriots at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the recently disclosed sinister scenario of the U.S. and puppet war-thirsty forces to unleash a war goes to clearly prove that their moves for a nuclear war against the DPRK have reached a reckless phase of its implementation. The warmongers may ignite a nuclear war any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their escalated moves for a nuclear war against the DPRK would only prompt the DPRK to hold higher the banner of Songun to deal deadly blows at the aggressors, provokers."
