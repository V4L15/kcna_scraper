            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Totally Rejects \"Experts' Meeting\" of Hostile Forces\r\nPyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK released the following statement Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The forces hostile toward the DPRK are trying hard to justify international cooperation for pressuring the DPRK by abusing the UN human rights arena as a theatre for \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the sideline of the 30th meeting of the UN Human Rights Council the U.S. and other hostile forces held what they called \"experts' meeting\" on the non-existent \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK where they cited the already-bankrupt anti-DPRK \"investigation report\" and \"human rights resolution\", finding fault with the DPRK and fanning up an international atmosphere critical of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK rejected the convention of the \"meeting\" itself and did not feel the need to take part in it from the beginning as it was clear that the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign is aimed at \"change of social system\" and \"replacement of regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the DPRK took part in the \"meeting\" to reveal before the international community the truth about the enemies' anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket as what would be mentioned at the \"meeting\" would be very provocative ones going beyond the tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As was anticipated, the \"meeting\" was proven again to be a sinister political farce aimed at \"overthrowing the social system\" of the DPRK under the pretext of human rights as it was a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that the U.S., chieftain of war of aggression and the biggest human rights abuser, took the lead in discussing someone's \"human rights issue\" while painting itself as an \"advocate of human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is an evil empire getting engrossed in harassing peace and committing all sorts of human rights abuses not only inside the country but in all other parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also the U.S. which caused the serious refugee issue sweeping the whole of Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. started wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and other parts of the world and fostered civil wars under the pretexts of \"war on terrorism\" and establishment of \"democracy\", refugees have been on sharp increase and there are increasing international voices blaming the U.S. for the refugee issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent \"experts' meeting\" glaringly revealed the clumsy nature of Japan and EU countries blindly obeying the U.S. for the sake of alliance, being indifferent to the encroachment upon the sovereignty of specified countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the improper attitude of the UN Human Rights Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from taking issue with serious human rights abuses that have become the target of worldwide denunciation and censure, the UN Human Rights Council, siding with the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, allowed itself to be used as leverage for putting pressure on specified countries. This abnormal development left the DPRK greatly skeptical about the principles of impartiality and strict neutrality touted by the body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If such practices are continuously fostered and connived, the international human rights arena will become a political confrontation theatre for serving interests of individual countries, not one for realizing genuine dialogue and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to wish for dialogue and cooperation for the protection and promotion of genuine human rights but to strongly reject dialogue and cooperation targeting sinister political purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK bitterly denounces the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign like the \"experts' meeting\" as an intolerable politically-motivated provocation and hardens its will to strongly counter the hostile forces' \"human rights\" racket to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will defend and further consolidate Korean-style socialist system, a cradle of a happy life of the Korean people, no matter what others may say."

            "content": "U.S. Is Not Entitled to Interfere in Issue of North-South Relations: Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- Those concerned of the White House, the U.S. State Department and Defense Department and the so-called north Korean experts vied one another to grumble that \"north Korea has reneged on its promise more than once and that at the talks between Obama and the south Korean chief executive the north's nuclear issue and 'human rights' issue are to be dealt seriously\" in a bid to drive a wedge in the relations between the north and the south. In the meantime, they are mulling hurling special warfare troops of the U.S. Army into south Korea from their mainland under the pretext of the \"north's provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t A commentary of Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says that this is a deliberate anti-reunification move to hobble the DPRK's efforts for defusing mistrust and contradiction between the north and the south and improving the relations by their concerted efforts, build up ill public opinion and egg the south Korean authorities on to fan up confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the U.S. is not entitled to interfere in the issue of relations between the north and the south, the commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. speaks loudly of its \"support\" for the improvement of the north-south relations but it is just a chicanery to conceal its dirty intention and justify its hostile policy toward the DPRK. When the north-south high-level urgent contact was in progress and the joint press release was made public, the U.S., hardly concealing its disturbed feelings, galvanized the public opinion with such story as \"the north's long-range missile threat\" and \"possible provocation in October\". This clearly proves its dirty nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation proves that the U.S. persistently seeks to isolate and stifle the DPRK through cooperation in the moves for escalating the confrontation with the DPRK while keeping the south Korean authorities from coming out for the improvement of the relations with the north under the plea of \"alliance\"."
