Madu\r\n Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, visited the revolutionary battle site in Mt. Madu.\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary battle site in Mt. Madu built as a secret base in the area of Anju in the period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle was a base for regional leadership, an important base for military operation in the western part of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There existed secret camps in Mts. Madu, Sang, Jon and Thukmaek in places favorable in terms of nature and geography and various revolutionary organizations were formed according to the operational plan of President Kim Il Sung. As a result, there appeared a reliable revolutionary fortress for making full preparations for all-people resistance and conducting an operation for a final attack for national liberation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After looking round the room for the education in trees bearing slogans, Kim Jong Un watched trees bearing slogans outside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The area of Anju where the revolutionary battle site is located was an important operational area for greeting the great event of national liberation, he noted, adding the fact that Kim Il Sung built a secret base there clearly proves that he was a peerlessly great man possessed of far-sighted wisdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He pointed out that the revolutionary battle site in Mt. Madu bears witness to the immortal exploits performed by Kim Il Sung for accomplishing the historic cause of national liberation and the indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean people who ushered in a new era of the national liberation struggle in colonies, holding him in high esteem as the center of unity and leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakable will and determination of the WPK to always uphold, carry forward and develop the revolutionary traditions established by Kim Il Sung and complete the Korean revolution, Kim Jong Un stressed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the employees of the revolutionary battle site, expressing great expectation and belief that they would successfully fulfill their honorable duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary battle sites are eternal treasures of the Korean revolution more precious than anything else and important bases for equipping the members of the party, working people, service personnel and youth and students with the revolutionary traditions of the WPK, he noted, setting forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for managing and operating them and intensifying the education through them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Ma Won Chun, Kim Yong Chol and Pak Jong Chon."

They all want peace, not a war, and co-existence and common interests of the north and the south, not division and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation suffered untold disasters from the 1950-1953 Korean War, enforced by the U.S. imperialists, and has been in the constant war danger for decades. So, peace is more precious to it than any other nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPeace is an indispensable prerequisite to the Korean nation's existence and development, and war exercises are a main factor of threatening its existence. If a war breaks out on the peninsula again, no one can get rid of being a victim to this terrible war that will endanger the nation's existence itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace is a fundamental guarantee for the country's reunification and prosperity common to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Without peace, is it impossible to expect the reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and their reunification as well as the nation's rosy future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only peaceful circumstance can help all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad build up the base of life for the nation better and achieve the national prosperity for all ages. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. and the south Korean authorities, turning aside the requirements of this stark reality, have staged the anti-DPRK nuclear war exercises from the start of the year, massively deploying nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity. They are going to launch the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military maneuvers late in February.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case such maneuvers lead to a skirmish and then develop into an all-out war, only the Korean nation will suffer deadly disasters from it and the Korean Peninsula will be reduced to ruins.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defending peace for the nation's security and prosperity can never go together with the war exercises that may entail its extermination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn end should be put to the war exercises of the U.S. and south Korea to ensure the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and protect the nation's destiny and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the Koreans who will lead in a responsible manner the anti-war struggle to defend peace from the prevailing danger of war on the peninsula. No one can protect peace in this land on behalf of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans at home and abroad who love the country and the nation should turn out as one in the struggle for peace."

            "content": "Son incompatibles la paz y los ejercicios belicos, apunta ACNC \r\n Pyongyang, 23 de enero (ACNC) -- En el Mensaje del Ano Nuevo, el Mariscal llamo a todos los integrantes de la nacion a levantarse en la lucha por defender la seguridad nacional y la paz para lograr un nuevo avance en el movimiento por la reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t En respuesta a este llamamiento, el Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea propuso a la parte Sur preparar el ambiente favorable a la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas y tomar las medidas practicas para defender la seguridad y la paz de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La propuesta, siendo una manifestacion de la voluntad patriotica de prevenir la tension militar y el peligro de guerra y lograr la paz duradera en la Peninsula Coreana, recibe fuertes aplausos de toda la nacion en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La paz es el anhelo nacional. Todos los miembros de la nacion no desean la guerra, la division y la confrontacion, sino la paz, la coexistencia y los intereses comunes entre el Norte y el Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La paz es mas preciosa que nada para la nacion coreana que sufrio incontables desastres por la guerra impuesta por el imperialismo norteamericano y vive durante varios decenios en medio de la amenaza de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La paz constituye la premisa indispensable para la subsistencia y el desarrollo de la nacion, pero, los ejercicios belicos devienen el factor principal que amenaza cada momento la vida de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La paz es la garantia fundamental para la reunificacion de la patria y la prosperidad comun de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al margen de la paz no se puede esperar la reconciliacion y cooperacion entre ambas partes coreanas, ni la radiante perspectiva de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Solo en el ambiente pacifico la nacion coreana en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar puede preparar mejores terrenos de la vida y lograr la eterna prosperidad de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, sin prestar oidos a esta demanda real, EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas libran desde principios de este ano los ejercicios de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC emplazando en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno enorme cantidad de pertrechos de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A finales de febrero, planean desarrollar los ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC de gran dimension Key Resolve y Foal Eagle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el caso de que esos simulacros provoquen un minimo conflicto armado y se extiendan a la guerra total, sufrira los desastres la nacion coreana y se arruinara el territorio patrio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Son incompatibles la defensa de la paz y los ejercicios belicos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para lograr la paz duradera de la Peninsula Coreana y defender el destino y seguridad de la nacion coreana, hay que acabar con los ejercicios belicos de EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy dia, la nacion coreana es la protagonista de la lucha contra la guerra y por la paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nadie puede defender la paz de Corea sustituyendo a la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los integrantes de la nacion en el interior y exterior del pais que aman el pais y la nacion deben levantarse como un solo hombre en la lucha por la defensa de la paz."
