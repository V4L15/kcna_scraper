The editorial calls on all the servicepersons and people to achieve great victory in the campaign by the force of single-minded unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: There are herculean tasks to be fulfilled during this campaign. However, we have nothing to fear and there is no unconquerable fortress for us now that we are under the outstanding leadership of the headquarters of the revolution, there is the foundation of the self-reliant national economy and the Party members and all other heroic people remain intensely loyal to the leadership of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A sure guarantee for victory in this gigantic struggle lies in encouraging all the people to bring about a new great surge in the Songun revolution by carrying forward the tradition established by the elders in the period of the great Chollima surge after the war. All the people should create a new tempo of advance in the new century with the same spirit and mettle as displayed by them when effecting that Chollima surge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the officials, Party members and other working people should set their hearts ablaze with the spirit of revolutionary soldiers, let all work sites seethe with the enthusiasm, mettle and traits of soldiers and intensify the scientific and technological revolution at all units of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"100-day campaign\" is a worthwhile struggle which will record a brilliant page in the history of the heroic struggle of the Korean people.

In order to protect peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world, it is necessary to wage a dynamic anti-imperialist and anti-war struggle. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to discard illusion and fear of imperialists in order to frustrate the imperialists' moves for aggression and war and defend peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more foolish act than harboring an illusion about imperialism, thinking that their aggressive and predatory nature has changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Illusion about imperialism just leads to self-ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One's fear of imperialism causes one to give up the anti-imperialist, anti-war struggle and yield to and compromise with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf one is afraid of fighting imperialists, shrunken by their bravado, one can never be free from their yoke of domination and subjugation nor can one protect global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to build military muscle in order to foil the imperialists' moves for aggression and war and defend global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lessons drawn from those countries which collapsed in face of the imperialists' military high-handed practices teach that one should defend sovereignty and peace of the country by one's own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war against terrorism being staged by the U.S. at present is a contemporary form of \"crusade\" aimed to dominate the whole world and control the destiny of the world people.

            "content": "U.S. Shameless Assertions Refuted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 5 (KCNA) -- The U.S. chief executive was reported to have expressed deep concern about the DPRK's declaration of its access to nuclear weapons at a recent U.S.-EU annual summit in the White House. Earlier, the head of the U.S. delegation at a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors charged that the DPRK is a \"challenger to NPT.\" \r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary carried in this regard says: Needless to say, it is foolish of the U.S. to try to lay the blame for the deadlocked six-party talks and their delayed resumption at the DPRK's door because Washington was chiefly accountable for having stood in the way of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the U.S. that compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons and was chiefly to blame for having barred the process of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. demand that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first, a bid to disarm it, is a revelation of Washington's extremely unreasonable unilateralism and its high-handed policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical for the U.S. to unilaterally demand the DPRK disarm itself though both have been in the hostile relationship  and technically at war for more than a half century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has gone so shameless as to try to brand the DPRK as a nuclear criminal by accusing it of challenging NPT. This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" At the NPT Review Conference held at the United Nations some time ago the U.S. was censured by the international community for having perpetrated crimes in violation of NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to work hard to get rid of its awkward position by removing the label of \"chieftain of nuclear proliferation\" and bringing the charge to the DPRK. But this is futile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has neither opposed nor shunned the six-party talks. The point at issue is that the U.S. attitude toward the six-party talks is opaque. If the U.S. persists in demanding the DPRK dismantle its nuclear program first without honoring its commitments, this will get it nowhere.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
