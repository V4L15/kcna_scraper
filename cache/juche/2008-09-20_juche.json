            "content": "Foreign Ministry Spokesman Blasts U.S. for Putting on Hold Effectuation of Its Measure \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Friday as regards the U.S. act of misleading the public opinion while persistently evading the implementation of the October 3 agreement: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK, it suspended the disablement of its nuclear facilities and a work has been under way to restore its nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon to their original state since some time ago as a counter-measure against the action taken by the U.S. to indefinitely put on hold the effectuation of the measure for delisting the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was a logical product of the U.S. non-abidance by the principle of \"action for action\" stipulated in the September 19 joint statement, the February 13 agreement and the October 3 agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, is asserting that the measure taken by the DPRK is in violation of the agreement of six parties while trying hard to convince the public that the DPRK's presentation of the nuclear declaration was premised on the verification in line with the \"international standard.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is sophism totally distorting the agreements so far reached to claim that the measure for taking the DPRK off the list of the \"state sponsors of terrorism\" was to take effect only when an agreement is made on the verification of the nuclear declaration in line with the \"international standard.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No verbal agreement, to say nothing of a written one on this issue was made either among the six parties or between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The core of the October 3 agreement is for the five parties including the U.S. to make political and economic compensation in return for the DPRK's disablement of its nuclear facilities and presentation of the declaration on its nuclear program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the commitment the U.S. was obliged to completely fulfill at the second phase for the implementation of the September 19 joint statement according to this October 3 agreement to implement the measure for delisting the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism.\" It is, therefore, an issue quite different from the verification of the nuclear declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of setting up a verification and monitoring mechanism which was agreed upon at the talks of heads of the delegations to the six-party talks in July was envisaged as a measure for verifying the fulfillment of the commitments by all six participating parties at the phase of realizing the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula according to the September 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the U.S. is foolishly trying to force the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear weapons unilaterally through pressure and deception while misleading the public opinion by creating impression that the process of the denuclearization was put into stalemate because the DPRK evaded the verification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. put on hold the effectuation of the measure for taking the DPRK off the list of \"state sponsors of terrorism,\" its commitment, under the pretext of the verification of the nuclear declaration in line with the \"international standard,\" though no agreement was made on it. This glaringly reveals its true intention to step up its hostile policy toward the DPRK in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to make a house-search of the DPRK, which is neither signatory to the NPT nor member of the IAEA, under the pretext of \"international standard.\" This is no more than a pipedream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. true colors are brought to light, the DPRK neither wishes to be delisted as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" nor expects such a thing to happen. It will go its own way. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean people will surely build a reunified, great prosperous powerful socialist nation in Korea with the might of single-minded unity, remaining loyal to Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the WPK and the DPRK government and the common desire of the peoples of the two countries to steadily boost the DPRK-China friendly and cooperative relations, he noted, adding: We, together with Chinese comrades, will as ever make every possible effort to consolidate and develop the bilateral friendship. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Well-known among them is the green tile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ornaments of roof tiles were multifarious to suit the style of the roof and the size and mission of the building. They presented effective ornamental combination between the color and shape of the roof tiles, the curved line of the roof, the color of painted rafters, red-and-blue painting and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For their practical and peculiar aesthetic values, the Korean roof tiles and their ornamental art are today widely used to preserve the national features of rural dwelling houses as well as gigantic architectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

History and reality prove that in order to achieve the country's reunification, the members of the nation should have strong consciousness of national independence and give full play to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's national self-respect is rooted in the long history and brilliant cultural tradition. The above-said self-respect is growing deeper as the nation is holding the peerlessly great persons in high esteem and demonstrating its dignity and honor to the whole world under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national self-respect serves as motive power promoting the great unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This national self-respect is being further exalted thanks to the idea of \"By our national itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans are now promoting great unity nationwide as the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is imbuing them with national self-respect and inspiring them in their efforts to achieve unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A nation never fails when it has high pride and self-respect and unshakable faith in victory. No force on earth can overpower a nation strong in self-respect and confident of victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification calls on all Koreans to fully display national self-respect and independently carve out their destiny, united close as one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are called upon to vigorously turn out in a nationwide struggle to usher in a new era of independent reunification and peace and prosperity with strong national self-respect, concludes the article. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the real aim sought by them in \"securing safe sea lane for escorting Japanese-flagged ships.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this scenario becomes a reality, the SDF will be able not only to operate as it pleases in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean but undertake offensive military actions against other countries under the pretext of \"protecting the security of Japanese-flagged ships.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists made the above-said call in a bid to cope with the situation where the expiry of the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" will deprive the SDF of any justification for staging military operations overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why they are making desperate efforts not just to extend the above-mentioned law but unlimitedly expand the sphere of the SDF's military operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intention of the Japanese militarists to justify the SDF's military actions in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean and, furthermore, conduct independent military actions under the pretence of \"escorting Japanese-flagged ships\" even if \"the motion calling for revising the above-said law\" fails to pass through the Diet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have worked hard to realize their ambition for reinvasion under the spurious signboard of \"ensuring peace.\" They are now leaving no means untried to justify the SDF's independent overseas military actions in a bid to launch overseas aggression. They do not shrink from any act in order to put their scenario for reinvasion into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important for protecting the peace and security in Asia and world peace to heighten vigilance against Japan and frustrate its moves for overseas aggression. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
