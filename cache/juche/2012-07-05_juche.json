            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Pyongyang Airport\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 5 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, gave field guidance to Pyongyang Airport.\n\t\t\t\t\t In August last year leader Kim Jong Il stressed the need to rebuild the airport on a modern basis and make good preparations for the project before undertaking the construction of Terminal 1 in full scale. He said that the project should be completed on the occasion of the centenary of the birth of President Kim Il Sung. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un went round the outside and inside of newly built Terminal 1. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Covering more than 1 729 square meters, the terminal is capable of giving best service to passengers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed big satisfaction over the fact that soldier-builders completed the project in a short span of time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched with deep attention the building covered mainly with glasses and partly with trimmed granite and ground stones and the platform with trimmed granite stones. He highly appreciated the peculiar Korean-style roof. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the walls of the main lobby and corridor decorated with large artificial stones, their floors with tiles and their ceilings with raised parts for lighting, he said the overall construction was done splendidly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He dropped in at every room having chandeliers of beads, round chandeliers and direct lighting lamps. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was briefed on Terminal 2 to be constructed before giving an important instruction for building the airport as required by the new century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to arrange waiting hall linked with the boarding gateways for convenience of passengers so that departures and arrivals may not overlap. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching a lay-out for Terminal 2, he said that it is better to distinguish the ground floor from the first floor, when viewed, so that its peculiarity may be preserved and look fashionable and overcome the monotonous look. He corrected the shortcomings of the design. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to spruce up Sunan area as befitting a gate to the capital city of Pyongyang and a satellite city while building Pyongyang Airport well. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the airport should have its appearance as an airport of the socialist country in contents and architectural style as required by the accommodating capacity because it should provide both international and domestic air service. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also stressed the need to successfully build the airport having terminals and facilities for safe and correct landing and take-off of planes and a control tower commanding the airport area. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang Airport should be constructed on the best level as it is a monumental edifice for all ages, he said, underscoring the need to ensure the quality in the project. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round passenger plane No. 633 and historical plane No. 535 used by President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He got aboard plane No. 633 to learn about the technical feature and operation of the plane. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he got aboard plane No. 535 and gave an instruction for preservation, management and operation of the plane."

Korea Military Alliance \r\n Pyongyang, July 5 (KCNA) -- The issue of the conclusion of a military agreement between south Korea and Japan has become a focus of international public attention.\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue including the matter of concluding the General Security of Military Information Agreement was brought up for discussion for the first time since the end of World War II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the conclusion of the agreement they ostensively put up the signboards of \"preserving peace\" and conducting \"exchange\" but they seek other aims through their military agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, in fact, part of the moves to round off the triangular military alliance involving the U.S., Japan and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-Japan-south Korea system for military cooperation in the past was the U.S.-led two way vertical one. The U.S. laid down a foundation for the triangular military alliance by concluding the \"mutual defence treaty\" with south Korea and the \"security treaty\" with Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in 2008 the U.S. laid down the guidelines calling on the U.S., Japan and south Korea to \"take joint military counter-actions\" in case they \"face security threats\" while talking about the \"offensive to pressurize north Korea through triangular cooperation\". It set up the \"tripartite coordination committee\" made up of \"government\" authorities and high-ranking officials of military and military research institutions and agreed to knock into shape the military cooperation system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On this basis, the U.S. has strongly pushed for military cooperation between south Korea and Japan. It was aimed to complete the triangular military alliance earlier than scheduled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conclusion of the south Korea-Japan military agreement would help the U.S. troops and the Japanese \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) emerge main forces of aggression within the framework of the above-said alliance with the puppet forces in \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula. It would, at the same time, help justify the SDF's advance into the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peninsula is now in the danger of falling victim to the U.S. Asia strategy and being reduced to a gambling site for big powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The triangular military alliance means an infrastructure of the U.S. strategy for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Return to Asia\" declared by the U.S. is becoming a reality thanks to the U.S. moves to tighten the alliance and build a missile shield.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the intention of the U.S. to put the tripartite joint military exercises on a regular basis every year after rounding off the institutional elements of the alliance in a bid to examine the efficiency of the alliance for a war and reinforce the system for combined operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These moves bring their aggressive nature to bolder relief.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-Japan-south Korea joint military exercises are going on in an unbroken chain within the framework of the alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces are busy staging various strike drills with huge forces involved with the U.S. forces. Japan is offering its territory to the U.S. as a relay base and operational and logistic bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japan-south Korea missile defence system with the U.S. as an axis is in the making. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the triangular military alliance is fully ready to go operational for a war any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Huan Qiu Shibao of China in its editorial said that the south Korea-Japan military agreement is aimed at strengthening the triangular military alliance but, in actually, targets against China though it ostensively aims at the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military nexus among the U.S., Japan and south Korea is absolutely unpardonable as it further aggravates the situation not only on the Korean Peninsula but in the rest of Northeast Asia."
