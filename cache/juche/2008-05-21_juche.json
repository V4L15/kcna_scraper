The long arm has a scale up to 10 chi (1chi is equal to 3.5 cm) on the outer edge of its front side and the short arm a scale up to 6 chi. The smallest unit of the basic scale is phun (1 phun equals 0.35 cm). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outer edge of the backside of the long arm is marked with an angle scale called \"Kumgang proportion\" in architecture. The unit length of the angle scale is the diagonal line of a square each side of which is the unit length of the basic scale. The angle scale, which represents the characteristics and ingenuity of the ruler, played an important role in architecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This ruler was widely used in economic field including city planning, architecture, agriculture and handicraft and in daily life in Paekje, Silla and Palhae as well as Koguryo and used in Koryo until the middle part of the dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wall of Pyongyang, the Anhak Palace, the Tomb of King Tongmyong and many other structures built in the years of Koguryo were designed and constructed with the help of the Koguryo ruler. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ruler served as the basic tool in instituting main measuring units of area, volume and weight, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not a mere yardstick measuring length but a multipurpose means of measurement reflecting mathematic knowledge, which made a great contribution to the development of science and technology, economy and culture in those days. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Minju Joson Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war due to the U.S. and south Korean war-thirsty forces' frantic war exercises to invade the DPRK, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention is that the moves of the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces to provoke a war against the DPRK have become evermore pronounced since Lee Myung Bak came to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee is now rushing headlong into sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with fellow countrymen while crying out for \"tightened alliance\" with the U.S. It is Lee group's ulterior intention to help the U.S. strengthen its domination over south Korea and increase its dependence on the former and do harm to fellow countrymen in reliance upon its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers regarded the seizure of power by Lee as the best chance to keep south Korea as its permanent colony and conquer the whole of Korea. Precisely for this reason the U.S. bellicose forces upgraded south Korea's status of purchasing American weaponry to the level of NATO and seek to use the puppet armed forces as a shock brigade and cannon fodder for a war of aggression against the DPRK, repeatedly delivering ultra-modern war equipment to south Korea and more frequently staging joint military exercises than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the above-said saber-rattling is overlooked, it is as clear as noonday that the Korean nation can never escape a nuclear disaster. The army and people of the DPRK are keeping themselves fully ready to foil the U.S. and south Korean warmongers' moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to face up to the reality, drop its aggressive policy toward the DPRK and urgently withdraw its troops from south Korea. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
