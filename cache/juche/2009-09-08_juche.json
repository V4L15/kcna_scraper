It successfully carried out the socialist revolution and vigorously accelerated socialist construction, thereby building a socialist state centered on the popular masses which demonstrates its might as a country independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in national defence and paving a wide avenue for the development of the country and the prosperity of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Il Sung's Juche-oriented idea of nation-building and his exploits performed in it have been steadfastly carried forward by General Secretary Kim Jong Il and the DPRK has reached a new higher stage in its development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il published the famous work \"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea Is a Socialist State of Juche with Invincible Might\" last year. This constitutes an immortal exploit as he provided ever-victorious guidelines for building a socialist state in the era of Songun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the outstanding Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il, Songun Korea, the country of Juche, is now towering high as a political, ideological, military and scientific and technological power, an envy of the whole world, and the Korean people have confidently come close to the gate to a thriving socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il and his independent foreign policy, the DPRK opened a new chapter of a nation-wide movement for national reunification guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" for the first time in the history of national division and the international prestige of the country and its influence have risen remarkably.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called on all the servicepersons of the KPA and people to hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem for all ages as the father of socialist Korea and eternal President of the DPRK and make the DPRK shine forever as the glorious state of Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also underlined the need to actively uphold and faithfully implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, a great programme for independent reunification, and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing it, and reenergize the movement for national reunification, taking \"By our nation itself\" as its basic idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will boost the solidarity with the peoples of all the countries in the world advocating independence, consistently holding  fast to the idea of independence, peace and friendship and wage a dynamic struggle for building an independent and peaceful new world against aggression and war in the future, too."

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force Command asserted that the U.S. is seriously concerned about underground nuclear facilities in north Korea or Iran.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday says this self-exposes that the U.S. manufacture of this type bomb is meant for using it when launching an armed invasion against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The news analyst goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now seeking to disable the DPRK's war deterrent for self-defence in a bid to upset the balance of forces and create military conditions favorable for carrying out its strategy for mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves of the U.S. made it all the more clearer that the \"peaceful settlement\" of the issue of the Korean Peninsula and \"diplomatic efforts for dialogue\" oft-repeated by the U.S. are nothing but rhetoric to deceive the public opinion at home and abroad and that military confrontation and use of force have become the keynote of the U.S. policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to clearly prove that the U.S. is, indeed, the arch criminal wrecking the world peace and security as it does not hesitate to commit the criminal act of inflicting even a nuclear war on mankind in a bid to realize its ambition for domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never pardon the U.S. keen to bring horrible disasters to the earth, obsessed by its wild ambition for world hegemony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to roll back at once its anachronistic policy of strength, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless hostile policy toward the DPRK."

Korea Demanded\r\n Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- If the United States persistently enforces its policy of military presence in south Korea, lending a deaf ear to the voices of the peoples of Korea and other countries of the world demanding the earliest withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea, it will face bitterer rebuff and denunciation at home and abroad. This warning is served by Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article carried 64 years since the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' landing in south Korea was aimed at keeping it under its occupation and turning it into its colony, dividing Korea into two parts and using its southern half as a military appendage for executing its policy of aggression, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to seek its forces' permanent presence in south Korea and bolster up its combat capability are a challenge to the demand of the times for the withdrawal of foreign troops and their trend.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should pull its forces out of south Korea as early as possible as demanded by international law and the times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The termination of the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea would remove the basic factor of threatening the peace in Korea and the biggest hurdle lying in the way of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pullback of the U.S. forces from south Korea would result in eliminating the most dangerous hotbed of war in the world and thus help create environment favorable for ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How to approach the issue of the U.S. forces' withdrawal from south Korea serves as a barometer judging whether the U.S. has a will to rectify its hostile policy towards the DPRK or not and whether it wishes to see Korea's reunification and peace or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is waiting for the U.S. to make a switchover in its attitude."
