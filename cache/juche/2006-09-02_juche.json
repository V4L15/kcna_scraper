            "content": "KCNA Urges Japan to Make Public Truth behind DNA Test \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- A member of a south Korean organization, to the astonishment of the public within and without, recently testified that the Japanese government, when requesting Teikyo University to test the remains of Megumi Yokota, prearranged the branding of the remains as fake.\r\n He exposed that the Japanese government and the \"Society for Relief\" were abusing the \"Megumi issue\" for a political purpose and they even took some \"defectors from the north\" to Japan and forced them to make poorly founded testimonies, while giving money to some south Koreans concerned to make them distort the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the DPRK has made sincere efforts to settle the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this course, the husband of Megumi Yokota handed her remains directly to the head of the Japanese government investigation team in response to the repeated entreaties of the Japanese side when the team was visiting Pyongyang in November 2004. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Furthermore, early in July this year, he complied with coverage by Japanese media and made clear once again the background of Megumi's death and the disposal of the remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese side concluded and declared that the remains were not of Megumi on the basis of results of a DNA test bereft of scientific and objective accuracy. Moreover, the Japanese side broadly spread fantastic public opinion that the dead woman was still alive, quite contrary to the efforts to settle the \"abduction issue\", crying that it would \"tackle the settlement of the issue on the assumption that all the victims to the abduction are alive\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us see the course of the DNA test of her remains. The Japanese side has ignored the elementary rules, the common knowledge in the transport, transfer, keeping and handling of remains and DNA test and publication of its results. It has not yet made public the test paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The results of the test made public by Japan have become a target of strong doubts and questions not only in other countries but in Japan. The British science magazine Nature also pointed to some points open to question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said south Korean testifier stated he heard from Japanese government officials concerned that the Japanese authorities had been informed of the death of Megumi and that Kaoru Hasuike who had been close to Megumi and her husband testified to her death after returning to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan continues to bring forward the already settled abduction issue, while sticking to the fiction that \"Megumi is alive\". What it seeks in this is to evade the settlement of its past and mislead public opinion, thus speeding up the revision of the constitution for overseas aggression and the building of a military giant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from the seeking of a sinister purpose by Japan so zealously as to make a perfunctory test on the assumption of the remains being fake, no one can deny the possibilities of some intrigue or fabrication such as the addition of remains of a third one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a clue furnished, Japan is not hesitant in such shameless gangster-like acts as blackmailing the testifier every day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Japanese of conscience and discretion should feel ashamed of the dastardly drama of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should make clear the truth behind the DNA test of the remains of Megumi to the international community and human conscience, punish those responsible and return the remains in their original state without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "All Koreans Called Upon to Force U.S. Imperialists to Redress Their Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- The Korean nation will never forget the 140-year long history of the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Korea but force the U.S. to pay for it a thousand times. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have worked hard to realize their design for aggression and domination over Korea for nearly one and a half centuries since the intrusion of their aggression ship \"General Sherman\" (August, 1866). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their aggression and plunder of Korea have never ceased even since the shameful defeat of the ship. After the defeat of the Japanese imperialists in the middle of the 20th century the U.S. imperialists landed in south Korea under the mask of \"liberator,\" intensifying their military aggression against Korea.   The U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemy of the Korean nation as they divided the homogeneous nation with a 5,000-year long history, imposing all sorts of national misfortune and pain upon it for such a long period of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Already in the early period of their occupation of south Korea they divided Korea into the north and the south by staging a \"separate election\" and cooking up a \"separate government.\" It was none other than the U.S. imperialists who cracked down at the point of the bayonet upon the patriotic struggle of the south Korean people to achieve national reunification against national division including the April 3 popular uprising on Jeju Island, the April 19 popular uprising and the Kwangju popular uprising. It was again they who torpedoed the inter-Korean dialogue for implementing the June 4 joint statement in the 1970s and the north-south agreement and the joint declaration for denuclearization in the 1990s. The U.S. moves against the reunification of Korea are still going on though the Koreans live in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean war ignited by the U.S. imperialists in the 1950s brought unspeakable disasters and misfortune to the Korean nation. Since the ceasefire they have watched for a chance to provoke another war against the DPRK as evidenced by the incident of the armed spy ship \"Pueblo,\" the incident of large spy plane \"EC-121ï¿½h and the Panmunjom incident. In the new century they have put spurs to bolstering up their combat forces under the pretexts of the relocation of their forces in south Korea and their \"strategic flexibility.\" They are frantically staging almost every day such large-scale joint military exercises targeted against the north as \"RSOI,\" \"Foal Eagle\" and \"Ulji Focus Lens.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They perpetrated all sorts of violence and pillage against south Koreans, regarding them as \"inferior people of a colony\" and \"field mice.\" As if it were not enough with this, they did not bother to shoot and stab civilians to death and drive their armored cars over them to kill them. This group of cannibals is the descendents of \"General Sherman.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said history of the U.S. imperialists' aggression of Korea is a history of the most monstrous and horrendous crimes against humanity as they wantonly violated the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and inflicted unspeakable misfortune and disasters upon the people. They are the sworn enemy of the entire Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "140-Year-Long History of U.S. Aggression against Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- The History Society of the DPRK made public a memorandum on Sept. 1 140 years since soldiers and people in the Walled City of Pyongyang waged a patriotic struggle against the U.S. imperialists' aggression ship General Sherman's illegal intrusion into the River Taedong to commit atrocities and sent it to the bottom of the river. \r\n The lengthy memorandum has three parts under the following sub-titles: \"1. The true colors of USS General Sherman and the U.S. imperialists' start of war to invade Korea,\" \"2. The U.S. imperialists' positive support to the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea and colonial rule over it\" and \"3. The chief architect of division of Korea and chieftain of war for dominating it.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The memorandum cites concrete facts to prove that the U.S. imperialists have ceaselessly committed all sorts of moves for aggression against Korea in every form and by all means for 140 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the memorandum, the ship was a scout ship dispatched by the U.S. imperialists to Korea under the disguise of \"a trade ship\" to reduce it to their commodity market and a base for looting raw materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the data about the ship Princess Royal, the predecessor of USS General Sherman, recently available from the San Francisco Museum in the U.S., it was a developed warship with a steam engine and the canvas belonging to the U.S. Navy in those times. It was equipped with four guns and had \"a great many rifles, shotguns and swords and a large quantity of shells and bullets aboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNeedless to say, it was a heavily armed ship for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mission of the ship was to play the role of an advance and scout party in order to carry out the U.S. government's Korea policy aimed at \"forcing Korea to open to it.\" The ship had operated according to the instructions of the U.S. government. It can be clearly evidenced by the fact that the ship sailed to China to \"protect the interests of the U.S. in China\" and was dispatched to Korea from there under the guise of a trade ship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was beaten hard by the defeat of the largest-ever expeditionary force since the civil war. It gave up its plan to conquer Korea single-handedly and started to look for its ally. It thus chose Japan as its suitable one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Japan forced Korea to sign the Kanghwa Island Treaty in February of 1876 the U.S. shouted for joy and worked out a scenario for aggression which called on Japan to impose an unequal treaty upon Korea. Taking advantage of \"good offices\" of Japan and the contradictions between the Ching Dynasty and Japan, the U.S. forced Korea to sign the \"Korea-U.S. Treaty\" on the 6th of April, 1882. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, while keeping their ambition to invade Korea under wraps, worked in the direction of openly instigating its ally Japan to occupy Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists perpetrated two wars of aggression (Sino-Japanese war and Russo-Japanese war) to seize Korea, a product of such cunning and insidious policy of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists fabricated with Japan the \"Taft-Katsura Agreement\" as a memorandum on the 29th of July in 1905, thus legally assuring Japan of their support to its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tragic \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" and \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" imposed upon Korea were products of the criminal conspiracy and tie-up between the U.S. and Japan to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea and their more than 40 year-long colonial rule over Korea always received strong support from the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After emerging the ringleader of world imperialism at the end of the World War II the U.S. imperialists schemed to start \"Crusade\" for the domination of the world from the Asian continent, the Korean Peninsula, in particular. They started this operation by dividing Korea, a crime against her people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 38th parallel was, from the outset, no more than a temporary line from which the forces of the Soviet Union and the U.S. were meant to wrest surrender from the imperial Japanese army. But the U.S. imperialists were so crafty as to use it for realizing its strategy to put the world under its domination. They brought into bolder relief their ambition to put south Korea under their permanent occupation and turn it into \"an outpost in the Far East.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After staging a separate election on May 10, the U.S. imperialists ignited a war in Korea on June 25, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the three-year-long war the barbarous U.S. imperialists killed millions of innocent Koreans in the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have not given up their moves to put Korea under their domination since the ceasefire. On contrary, they have become all the more undisguised in their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. The U.S. Korea strategy pursued from Eisenhower to the present Bush administration is to stifle the DPRK with nuclear weapons by provoking another war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such large-scale war drills as \"Team Spirit\", \"Foal Eagle\" and \"Ulji Focus Lens\" staged by the U.S. imperialists across south Korea numbered more than tens of thousands with a total of 20 million troops involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their frantic and reckless moves to start a war have always pushed the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war since the ceasefire. They had perpetrated more than 150,000 cases of military provocations against the DPRK up to 1999 since the ceasefire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves for aggression, domination and war against Korea have reached an extreme phase due to the vicious moves of the present Bush administration to isolate and stifle the DPRK and its anti-reunification moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are a stumbling block lying in the way of reunification of Korea as they have pursued a separatist policy for such a long period of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The above-said history of the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Korea self-exposes before the world that the U.S. is the sworn enemy of the Korean nation as it imposed only subjugation, division and war upon the people century after century, the memorandum noted, stressing the Korean people will surely settle accounts with the U.S. imperialist aggressors for their crime-woven history under the uplifted banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their moves for invading the DPRK have reached an extremely reckless phase. The large-scale \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises now being staged by the U.S. in south Korea are a dangerous prelude to a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. The extremely provocative joint military maneuvers aimed to invade the DPRK are a clear proof that the U.S. imperialist war maniacs are set to unhesitatingly resort to a military adventure to realize their long-harbored ambition to seize the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war have done tremendous harm to the Korean nation striving hard to carve out its destiny by itself and achieve uniform development of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun calls upon all Koreans in the north, the south and abroad to turn out as one in the nation-wide anti-U.S. struggle to put an end to the U.S. imperialists' military occupation and domination over south Korea and smash their moves to provoke a war against the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Urged by its idea and mission, the NAM should wage a more relentless struggle for independence against imperialism and peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM is a mighty anti-imperialist revolutionary force in the present era. The key to a victorious advance of the NAM lies in advancing under the uplifted banner of the struggle for independence and peace against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Openly pursuing a double and discriminative policy, the United States is wallowing in one-man show and arbitrariness and is getting more outspoken in the threat of preemptive nuclear attack on the anti-imperialist independent countries. The strong-arm practices of the U.S. are reducing the international nuclear non-proliferation system including the NPT to dead wood and pushing non-nuclear states toward the possession of nuclear deterrent for their self defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM should pay due attention to the injustice and consequences of the application of double standards to the international relations and put up a collective rebuff to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' \"war on terrorism\" is a gangster-like act of aggression on sovereign states and an escalation of the war for the conquest of the world. If such aggressive \"war\" is overlooked and the struggle against it is neglected, its victims will, in the long run, be the non-aligned and developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is non other than the U.S. that drives a wedge among NAM countries and split and sow discord among them and egg them on to dispute and conflict. The guarantee for the preservation of the NAM and its development lies in the struggle to defend peace against imperialism and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential now for the NAM countries to intensify the joint action so that the principle of respect for sovereignty may be strictly guaranteed in handling outstanding major international problems including disarmament, human rights and UN reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efforts to intensify the NAM and rejuvenate its activities should be promoted in such a manner as to uphold its principle and idea and strengthen the unity and solidarity of its member states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Righteous are the idea and purpose of the NAM. No one can block the process of its advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government is making every possible effort to invariably adhere to the basic principles and idea of the NAM, ensure its purity and steadily strengthen and develop it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was the result of the successful embodiment of the Juche-oriented aesthetic idea of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the seminar recalled that he led creators and artistes with warm care, watching the films. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They noted that the creative activities to embody the Juche-oriented aesthetic idea of the Workers' Party of Korea helped them keenly realize that one can find profound idea and significant theme in everyday life and any attempt to depict what happened in the past from a dogmatic point of view when dealing with any historical event would not have any impact on the ideological and moral aspects of the Korean people's life in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those activities also helped creators and artistes overcome the tendencies of naturalism and creating masterpieces ignoring truth of life and producers remarkably raise the level of their dramaturgy and editing skill and actors and actresses present truthful and impressive acting, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They pointed out that the Juche-oriented aesthetic idea gave perfect answers to all theoretical and practical questions arising in the creation of masterpieces such as an issue of shooting anything to make it appear real, issue of theme song and music to go with scenes and the issue of recording dialogues and sound effects to suit the atmosphere and environment of any activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called on all creators and artistes to create more masterpieces in the Songun era in hearty response to the Party's Juche-oriented idea and theory of literature and art.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And there were several more chances to score a goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Hwa kicked the ball from the left corner around the 41st minute of the second half before sweeper Ri Un Hyang kicked the ball into the opponent's net when there was confusion.
