            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Myohyangsan Children's Camp \r\n Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), together with Ri Sol Ju visited Pyongyang Myohyangsan Children's Camp situated at the foot of Mt. Myohyang in North Phyongan Province on Sunday. \n\t\t\t\t\t Before the monument to the instruction of President Kim Il Sung that one's camping in secondary school days would be unforgettable in one's whole life, Kim Jong Un said it is very meaningful one. He looked back with deep emotion on the President's history of loving care for posterity with which he made sure that children's camps were built in scenic spots of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that General Secretary Kim Jong Il proposed on number of occasions the task for successfully rebuilding the children's camp and personally examined its design in the last period of his life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to newly build the camp to be proud of in the world as early as possible and thus carry out without fail the behest of Kim Jong Il who made so much effort to provide a better camp to children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round various places including bedrooms, the  room for disseminating knowledge about camping, room for the Children's Union, room for cultural information service, room for the preservation of gifts, music room, dinning room and hall to learn in detail about children's camping.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that to build the camp as required by the era of Songun is an important work for realizing the lifelong desire of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who did everything for the children as their tender-hearted father all their lives. He called for newly building the camp instead of remodeling it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are songs \"We Are the Happiest in the World\" and \"General to Front while Children to Camps\" loved by the children, he noted, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I remember the loving care shown by the Generalissimos for posterity whenever I listen to those songs. There is a mountain of work to be done for building a thriving nation, but we must not spare investment in the building of camps. It is the determination of the party to excellently remodel not only this camp but all other camps, children's palaces and children's houses across the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When remodeling camps across the country, it is necessary to spruce up camps at the foot of mountains to match their landscape and those camps on seaside to do its landscape, and to this end it is important to work out designs well, he said, adding that he would send a standard design.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the main objective of the revolution being made despite manifold difficulties and trials is to bring happiness to the children and it is necessary to enable them to lead a happy life with no more desire in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That day he met with the children of different schools enjoying camping there and had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, director of the KPA General Political Bureau, Choe Hwi, first vice department director of the C.C., WPK, and Pak Thae Song, vice department director of the C.C., WPK."

An aim sought by the U.S. through joint military exercises is to realize with ease its strategy for invading the DPRK through disarmament.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. attached great strategic meanings to the war maneuvers this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through a series of joint military maneuvers the U.S. has sought, first of all, to violate the sovereignty of the Korean people and their rights to existence and development. It also has sought to beef up its huge nuclear force on the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity pursuant to its strategy of prioritizing the Asia-Pacific region, and thus annex the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By engaging in nuclear threats with the use of massive nuclear war hardware, the hostile forces have pushed forward an immediate task of turning the DPRK, a nuclear weapons state, into a non-nuclear state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the common practices by the U.S. in the international arena to make a case with hostile act, pose a military threat based on it and turn the aggressive wild ambition into a reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent war maneuvers were a result of the U.S. hostile act against the DPRK that assumed military dimensions and has become more violent following the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes. The U.S., in fact, referred the issue of the DPRK's sovereignty and right to self-defence to the UN and now tries to turn the DPRK to the non-nuclear direction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A country possessed of a powerful nuclear deterrence can disable any strategies of the imperialists for demonstrating military strength, timely frustrate any scheme of the hostile forces and achieve prosperity.
