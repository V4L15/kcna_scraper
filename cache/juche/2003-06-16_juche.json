            "content": "Japanese authorities urged not to block humanitarian service of Mangyongbong-92 \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities recently set in motion ministries and agencies concerned including the Maritime Safety Agency and the Ministry of National Land and Communications to watch, inspect and control ship \"Mangyongbong-92\" when it enters or leaves the port and during its anchoring, describing the ship as a \"ship for illegal remittance\", \"spy ship\", \"ship transporting nuclear and missile parts\" and \"abduction and drug smuggling ship.\"\r\n Minju Joson today in a signed commentary denounces these allegations as premeditated and deliberate provocations to prevent Koreans in Japan from visiting their homeland and malign the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and the DPRK by barring the sail of the ship to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As to the ship \"Mangyongbong-92,\" the only thing it has done so far since its first service was that it has provided the repatriation and home-visiting of Koreans from Japan and carried cargoes, exports, humanitarian aid materials, etc. to their destination, sailing between the DPRK and Japan. It only carried those persons and cargoes undergone Japanese customs inspection while strictly observing Japanese legislations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, there is nothing to be questioned as the ship has not defied international law and has done nothing contrary to the Japanese laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It attracts our special attention that the Japanese authorities' provocative act against the ship has been viciously conducted after the recent U.S.-South Korea and the U.S.-Japan summit talks at which they had a confab on escalating hostile policy towards the DPRK and containing it by force under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should act in the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, with normal consideration, rectify its hostile policy towards the DPRK and ensure smooth service of the ship.    \r\n\r\n"

The Korean nation should get the U.S. forces withdrawn from South Korea by its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should refrain from cooperating with the outsiders in their anti-DPRK racket to start a new war but join the nation in its efforts to sincerely implement the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should uphold the slogan of \"by our nation itself\" and firmly unite with political parties, organizations and figures from all walks of life who support and wish the independent reunification of the country regardless of whether they are persons in power or civilians and irrespective of their party affiliation, ideology and political views. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should frustrate all the U.S. moves to bar the inter-Korean relations from improving and perpetuate the division of Korea and certainly force it to pay a high price for all sorts of untold misfortune and crimes it has brought to the Korean nation for nearly 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRk's Songun policy is a genuine patriotic policy as it defends the dignity and the sovereignty of the entire nation and guarantees the safety and the prosperity of the nation, he said, calling upon all the Koreans to actively support the Songun policy and uphold it with one and the same patriotic mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then its attendants listened the recorded congratulatory speeches sent to the festival by leader Kim Chol of Chondoism, permanent representative of the preparatory committee of the headquarters for the promotion of 2003 joint national events in South Korea on behalf of the south side and General Secretary Rim Min Sik of the joint secretariat of Pomminryon on behalf of overseas side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called for rejecting the outside interference through national cooperation and thoroughly implementing the joint declaration to achieve national reunification, the desire of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An appeal to the 70 million Koreans upon which the north, south and overseas preparatory committees for the grand national festival for reunification agreed was read out at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNoting that the unity of the whole nation paves the way for opening a bright prospect of achieving reconciliation and reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation and preventing the disaster of war and guaranteeing the survival of the nation and its prosperity, the appeal called for promoting the national reconciliation and unity and vigorously ushering in an era of national independence and peace. \r\n Whoever loves the country and nation should support the joint declaration and actively turn out to implement it irrespective of ideology, religious belief and political view, the appeal noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by Kim Yong Sae, chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party who is chairman of the north side's preparatory committee for the festival, Ryu Mi Yong, chairperson of the C.C., the Chondoist Chongu Party, senior officials of social organizations, officials of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, officials of the scientific, educational, cultural and art and public health and press institutions and overseas compatriots staying in the socialist homeland.    \r\n\r\n"

The Prime Minister rendered the \"peace constitution\" politically dead when he openly underscored the need to revise the constitution, saying that \"Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) means an army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Timed to coincide with his outbursts, the right-wing reactionaries let loose a spate of outcries calling for a war and justifying Japan's past crimes, something unprecedented in its history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts call upon the international community to be beware of Japan moving so fast to emerge a military power and launch its expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has taken a series of judicial measures in a bid to render the postwar \"peace constitution\" invalid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Three bills on \"emergency\" were passed through the diet by a majority vote recently. This is little short of completely ditching the \"peace constitution\", which had been hard hit by the carriage of the \"law on emergency in surrounding areas\" and the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan keen on emerging a political power, had long called for \"emergency\" legislations only to meet a strong rebuff of anti-war forces at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"law on overseas troop dispatch\" and the \"law on emergency in surrounding areas\" were adopted after the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War in the 1990s. They paved the way for the overseas advance of the SDF and the steady expansion of the sphere of its activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has actively joined in war actions in various regions under the pretext of \"supporting anti-terrorism war\" taking the reckless war fought by the U.S. against terrorism after the \"September 11 incident\" as the golden opportunity of adopting \"laws on emergency\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan listed the DPRK as the first target of its overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is clearly proved by the fact that Japan cited the non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK as a pretext to adopt the dangerous and aggressive laws on \"emergency\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet shaken off its disgrace of being an enemy state though over half a century has passed since the end of the war. Its attempt to justify its war actions will only aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula that remains complicated due to its nuclear issue and escalate the military tensions among Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to drop its old dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA attacks Japan's hostile action against DPRK ship\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Nowadays, the Japanese authorities are persistently pursuing a hostile policy towards the DPRK, in support of the U.S. strategy aimed to stifle the DPRK.\r\n Such policy has clearly been evidenced by the fact that they used the largest security forces and means to check the service of DPRK's ship \"Mangyongbong-92\". This cannot but be taken as a serious development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such action is a sinister move to impair the growing international prestige of the DPRK and sap its influence. It is also one more political repression of Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan), a dignified overseas citizens organization of the DPRK, and Korean residents in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable breach of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, in which the two countries agreed to settle their unpleasant past and establish fresh good-neighborly and friendly relations, and a grave provocation endangering the destiny and the prospect of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past ten-odd years the ship \"Mangyongbong-92\" has sailed from Wonsan to Niigata as a symbol of humanitarianism and DPRK-Japan friendship, doing nothing contrary to the Japanese and international laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities have branded this unsuspicious ship as a \"ship for illegal remittance\", \"spy ship\" and \"carrier of nuclear and missile components\". Under the pretext of \"inspection\" of the ship, they set in motion relevant ministries and agencies and sent at least 10 vessels of the maritime safety agency and nearly 2,000 security agents to Niigata port, creating a terror-ridden atmosphere that can be seen only in case of emergency so as to prevent the ship from entering the port. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have long resorted to all sorts of wrongdoings targeted against the ship. Finding it impossible to stop the ship from making service on the strength of the present law, the authorities called for \"inspection of equipment\" of the ship all of sudden although it is equipped with modern facilities and has provided routine services without an accident so far and went to the lengths of resorting to such a mean act of putting a brake on its routine service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts suffice to prove that the Japanese reactionaries' moves against the DPRK are being put into mean and dangerous practice beyond the smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious is that the Japanese government is playing the role of a shock brigade in carrying out the \"further steps\" and the \"hard-line measures\" against the DPRK discussed at the summit talks of the U.S., Japan and South Korea as regards the DPRK's \"nuclear issue,\" while becoming more undisguised in its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By preventing the service of Mangyongbong-92 the Japanese authorities more glaringly revealed their unethical and immoral true nature as they did not hesitate to infringe upon the humanitarian idea and even the international relations to carry out the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this means the start of their \"sanctions\" against the DPRK, it would entail very serious consequences. The Japanese authorities should mind p's and q's about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the authorities keep barring the service of the ship despite the DPRK's warnings, it will be compelled to take a necessary countermeasure and Japan will be held wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has a great Songun policy and unbreakable singlehearted unity. It also has potential and will strong enough to put its resolution into practice.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GIs' crimes in S. Korea disclosed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth Behind the GIs' Massacres on June 13 issued the fifth instalment of a joint white paper, disclosing just part of the crimes the u.s. imperialists committed in South Korea from 1957 to 1959.\r\n The paper said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period GIs killed innocent South Koreans, committed violence against them and looted their properties and valuables or destroyed them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On February 25, 1958, GIs stationed in Puphyong, Inchon detained Kim Chun Il, 14-year-old shoe-shining boy in an officers' quarters for no reason and brutally clubbed, whipped and stabbed him. As if it were not enough with this, they pulled his toenails and hair with a pair of pincers and cut it with an electric hair-clipper. Then they painted his head and face with tar before putting him into a wooden box. After nailing the box they carried it by a helicopter and dropped it over an airfield of the U.S. first army corps in Uijongbu, Kyonggi Province. This shuddering case is called a Puphyong incident of throwing away a boy inside a box from a helicopter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIs killed South Koreans in the most brutal and barbarous way and committed violence against them, regardless of time and place. For example, they shot a 3-year-old child to death, on a charge that he stole gasoline. They indiscriminately fired guns at South Koreans considering them to be pheasants or animals, thus killing or seriously wounding them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At around 10 p.m. on December 31, 1959, GIs forcibly took Pak Hwa Ja, 20, residing in Kodung-gol, Karung-ri, Uijongbu-up, and Yun Sun Ja, 25, residing in Saengyon-ri, Tongduchon-up in Yangju county, Kyonggi Province, to their barracks. There they stripped them off and painted their backs and lower parts of their bodies brown and kicked them out of the barracks. This monstrous and barbarous outrage is called the \"Uijongbu incident of painting women.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIs' rape of South Korean women increased on a daily basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the first four months of 1959 the rape case numbered over 100. GIs did not care at all whether it was a 14-year-old girl or a 50-year-old woman to satisfy their carnal desires and employed every possible means and method for this crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On April 22, 1957, at least 80 MPs belonging to the 24th division of the U.S. army encircled 184 houses in areas around Yonphung-ri, Phaju county and illegally searched more than 100 stores and dwelling houses to rob them of 70,000 hwan and 2,324 articles worth about 10 million hwan at market price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From June 3 to 9 in 1959 GIs including lieut. Commander Francis Fox, chief of the mp office of the construction battalion of the U.S. forces in far east, stationed in Uljiro, central district, Seoul searched the house of lady Jong Jin Suk in Huam-dong, Pyongsan district, Seoul, several times, looting articles. Not content with it, they took her to the mp office and searched her after denuding her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the ceasefire till today the GIs committed more than 2,000 cases of murder and all other crimes in South Korea on an annual average, killing or wounding more than 100,000 innocent citizens. This clearly reveals their true colours as the chief culprit of murder and brutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never forgive the u.s. imperialist aggressors, the source of all sorts of misfortune, sufferings and disasters of the Koreans' despite the flow of time but will certainly force them to pay for their crimes a thousand times.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA issues detailed report on third anniversary of joint declaration\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency today issued a detailed report on the occasion of the third anniversary of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n According to the report, the energetic guidance provided by General Secretary Kim Jong Il for carrying through the instructions of President Kim Il Sung for national reunification brought about a historic meeting of the heads of north and south Korea in Pyongyang in June Juche 89 (2000), the first of its kind in the history of national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il met with the South Korean President for hours to have an open-hearted discussion on important matters related to the destiny of the nation and national reunification. This resulted in the publication of the joint declaration, the banner of reconciliation, unity and independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has wisely led a struggle to preserve and implement it to the letter so that it may fully display its vitality as a declaration of national independence, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our republic has since reacted to the U.S. hard line to stifle the DPRK with the toughest stand and decisively countered the U.S. attempt to meddle in the issue of the Korean nation by the united efforts of the nation. And it has firmly maintained the principle of solving the problems raised in such a way as to create a favorable environment for the reconciliation, unity and reunification of the nation, always placing its interests above anything else, when conducting dialogue with the U.S. and improving its relations with the countries that have long been hostile toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the inter-Korean dialogues and contacts including ministerial talks have been held on the principle of national independence and cooperation and exchanges have taken place for the common prosperity of the nation. When an unpleasant incident occurred between the north and the south of Korea owing to the U.S. intervention and provocations, they set a good precedent by settling their issues on the basis of placing the destiny and interests of the nation above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Former honorary chairman Jong Ju Yong of the Hyundai Group of South Korea, representatives of South Korean media organizations, the chief delegate of the south side delegation to the second inter-Korean ministerial talks, the then chairwoman of the preparatory committee for founding the \"Union for the Future of Korea,\" a South Korean songstress and her party from Japan and other personages of South Korean political parties, groupings and circles and compatriots have visited Pyongyang  one after another since the June summit meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Articles laid down in the joint declaration have been implemented to the letter. As a result, at least 60 unconverted long-term prisoners were repatriated early in September Juche 89 (2000) and reunions of separated families and relatives which had been held in Pyongyang and Seoul took place at the world-famous Mt. Kumgang Resort as more meaningful and broad-based events. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to information available, nearly 300 dialogues, contacts, exchanges and joint events have taken place so far since the historic Pyongyang summit meeting. Among them are inter-Korean ministerial talks, red cross talks, meetings of the north-south committee for the promotion of economic cooperation and other inter-sector talks, joint events of the nation that took place on June 15, August 15, May Day, March 1 and on many other important occasions and cooperation and exchanges in economic, public, scientific, cultural and sports and other fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last three years of inter-Korean relations showed that the nation defeated outsiders, patriotism prevailed over treachery, reunification beat division and progressives, conservatives, social classes and strata, persons in power and civilians advanced in unity only for the destiny of the fellow countrymen and the settlement of the reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the present reality of inter-Korean relations that the joy and sorrow of the northerners are considered as those of the southerners and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of patriotic Songun policy and the great vitality of the joint declaration have made the entire nation on the Korean Peninsula stand in confrontation with the U.S. and brought about a rapid growth in pro-reunification patriotic forces. Much upset by this, the reactionaries at home and abroad have become more reckless in their challenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Korean people's will for reunification and faith based on the spirit of the joint declaration are so firm and transparent as to emerge ever-victorious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can block the dynamic march of the Koreans for reunification and they are sure to win as they are led by  Kim Jong Il and there are the Songun policy very instrumental in the efforts for national independence and reunification and the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He called for making joint efforts to speed up the opening to traffic of railways and roads between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ceremony of reconnecting railways on the west coast was addressed by director of the Ministry of Land and Environment Preservation Kim Pyong Chil, who is a member of the north side to the north-south committee for the promotion of economic cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: The main artery of the nation between Mt. Paektu and Mt. Halla has been reconnected and the fellow countrymen's advance towards reconciliation, unity and reunification is being more dynamically accelerated. This thrilling reality today clearly proves validity of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea \"by our nation itself\" is, indeed, a great proposition for national reunification, he said, adding that it will be possible to totally pull down the barrier of division and reunify the country if the Koreans go hand in hand, regardless of any change in the situation at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In his address, the chief delegate of the south side to the panel said the reconnection of rail and road links between the south and the north would promote the exchange and cooperation between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the speeches, a work was done to reconnect rails at the points of the military demarcation line between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the participants screwed bolts and nuts to connect rails and laid gravels.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
