            "content": "Military Tie-up of US and S. Korea Flailed\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, November 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea in a statement on Thursday denounced the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group for their military tie-up and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During his recent U.S junket, the south Korean chief executive visited the Defense Department and had a military confab. On Oct. 27 and 28 the U.S. and south Korean puppet warmongers held a meeting of the military committee and annual security consultative meeting in Seoul at which they talked about \"U.S. forces' involvement in local war\" and \"tailored deterrence strategy\". They are, at the same time, comprehensively supplementing and rounding off anti-north war scenarios as evidenced by their working out of a new joint operation plan to cope with someone's \"start of a local war.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are staging war maneuvers for a war of aggression against the north almost everyday in Phohang, North Kyongsang Province and the areas close to the north including areas along the Military Demarcation Line and Paekryong Island, talking about Hoguk exercises and the like in a bid to put them into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are stepping up the preparations for a war of aggression against the north. For instance, they are busy reorganizing and strengthening the combined control system of the U.S. forces and the puppet forces and handing over large quantities of U.S. latest war hardware to the puppet forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Branding their military tie-up and war moves as the dangerous actions to wreck peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, spark a new Cold War and arms race and ignite a war, the spokesman said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical for the U.S. and the puppet forces to justify the above-said military nexus and war moves under the pretext of \"provocations\" from someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the puppet group which sets up targets insulting the system and dignity of the DPRK and fires bullets and shells at them, seriously getting on its nerves and perpetrates such reckless provocations as scattering leaflets and airing conspiratorial broadcasting programs little short of war actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is again the puppet group and the U.S. military bosses that are unhesitatingly letting loose a spate of provocative outbursts such as \"air operation beyond air over the Military Demarcation Line\" and \"preemptive strike\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the U.S. and the puppet group are talking about \"provocations\" from someone and the like. This reminds one of the proverb: A thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their ever-more tightened military nexus and intensified war moves go to prove that  \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" on their lips are hypocritical and they have only the ulterior intention to do harm to the other party. Their use of force would get them nowhere. They are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can browbeat the DPRK by recourse to force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  \"Provocation\" and \"threat\" are the stereotyped words used by aggressors when pulling up the other side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready for both local warfare and all-out war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its revolutionary forces will mercilessly smash such things as \"tailored deterrence strategy\" with the tremendous might of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet group would be well advised to stop their foolish acts, bearing deep in mind the disastrous consequences to be entailed by the above-said reckless moves."

This opinion was expressed most strongly by inhabitants in those countries where capitalism was restored, by 77% in Russia and 75% in Ukraine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a forum on \"Future of capitalism\" cosponsored by Japan's newspaper Asahi Shimbun and Tokyo University, Katsuto Iwai, professor of the Economy Faculty of Tokyo University, said: Socialism is no longer foe of capitalism. New foe is laissez-faire, the ideological viewpoint of capitalism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though bourgeois reactionaries and their servants have got hell-bent on crackdown on the \"Occupy Wall Street\" demos by mobilizing mounted police and helicopters, the fighting spirit of the peoples in the demos to get rid of exploitation and oppression by capital is running higher.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that the more capitalism reveals its reactionary nature and weakness, the deeper the world people's trust in socialism grows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Socialism gained rich experience and lessons in the course of going through painful setbacks and trials and is advancing full of vigor and energy on a broader and more solid class basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the forces are aspiring after socialism, the forces that are opposed to war of aggression and advocate world peace, democracy, freedom, equality and justice and the forces that love countries and struggle to protect rights and interests of their peoples. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present era is that of historical turn in which the world people are dynamically advancing toward independence and socialism while capitalism is nearing its end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Future of humankind depends on socialism as a science."
