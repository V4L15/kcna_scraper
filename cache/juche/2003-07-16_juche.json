The experience of the Korean people's struggle gives the truth that nobody can match the people single-heartedly united around the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive people of the world will never forget the immortal contributions of Kim Il Sung. He will always live in the hearts of the fighting people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The friendly Korean people are now firmly defending the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation as they are led by leader Kim Jong Il who is identical with Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers pointed out that they would always send firm solidarity to the just cause of the Korean people.    \r\n    \r\n"

It termed this move a blatant military threat to the north.\r\n The commentary noted that it is not only a violation of the armistice agreement, a serious action to provoke a war but part of its moves to isolate the north internationally to lead the situation to an extreme pitch of tension, talking about unconfirmed \"north's sale of weapons of mass destruction and its drug smuggling.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the U.S. is to entirely blame for the danger of war in Korea, the commentary noted that the South Korean people would intensify the struggle against the U.S. which has escalated its military threat to the north, refusing to respond to the north-proposed bilateral talks.    \r\n\r\n"

What is serious is that the Japanese militarists' chariot is running of itself before the U.S., its senior master, holds the chariot by the bridle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ambitious dream of the Japanese militarists to become a leader in Asia is becoming a reality. The first target of the Japanese militarist forces in its overseas aggression is the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's heading for overseas aggression will do Japan nothing good for its security and future.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "EU, U.S. at loggerheads over global structure =KCNA news analyst's article= \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA) -- The friction between the United States seeking unipolar world and the European Union calling for multipolar world is getting serious.\r\n When the U.S. unilaterally launched an invasion of Iraq in violation of UN resolutions and in disregard of majority countries' strong opposition, the anti-war forces of the EU bitterly denounced the U.S. for turning the United Nations into a tool for its strategy of hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Finding themselves in an awkward position, the hawks of the Bush administration, called neo-conservatives, termed France, Germany and other countries  \"Old Europe\", while describing as \"New Europe\" some East European nations that voiced support for its invasion of Iraq, in the hope of drumming up support in the continent with them as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Condoleezza Rice, assistant to the U.S. President for National Security, on June 25 reiterated the strategy of the Bush administration that the world should become a unipolar world based on the American-style view of value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prompted by this strategy, the U.S. seeks to split up the ever expanding EU by aggravating contradiction and confrontation between the EU \"Representing Old Europe\", and pro-U.S. East European nations \"Representing New Europe\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n France and Germany play a principal role in the EU but they are subordinated to the U.S. in NATO. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing itself of this advantage, the U.S. is trying to rent the EU in the way of rapidly expanding NATO. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Confronted with the U.S. unilateral hegemonism, the EU is exerting efforts to have Europe on an equal footing with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The EU has put forward a proposal of the founding of Europe's common defence forces for the purpose of overcoming its weakness in NATO over the security issue and enhancing its position and influence. It is now pushing ahead with the implementation of the proposal, while challenging the U.S. high-handed and unilateral practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It intends to inveigle ten East European nations including the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the EU until 2004 in a bid to destroy the U.S. supremacy over Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is noteworthy is that the EU is trying to materialize the plan of multipolar world in such a way as strengthening its political and military relations with Russia and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the world economy tending towards multipolarity, the EU advanced a plan of a \"new triangle\" involving North America, Europe and the East Asian economic region. It is indicative of the EU's desire to exercise equal influence with the U.S. in the coordination of the global structure and promote multipolarity through mutual economic dependence, rejecting the \"old triangle\" involving the U.S., Europe and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts reveal that the conflict between the EU and the U.S. in the strategic interests has already come up to the surface and that the subordinate U.S.-EU alliance the former established after the end of the Cold War is now on the edge of collapse.    \r\n\r\n"
