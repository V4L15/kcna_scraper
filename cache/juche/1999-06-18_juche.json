These were a wanton violation of the Korean armistice agreement, an open challenge to the north and premeditated ones intended to unleash a war against the north, stress newspapers here today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun says in a signed commentary:   The current provocations were not accidental because the South Korean warthirsty elements infiltrated warships into north side's territorial waters almost every day from several days ago, threatening our defenseless fishing boats, and recklessly bumped against our navy ships several times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are repeatedly calling for \"full alert\" and \"strong counteraction,\" attempting in a far-fetched manner to shift the blame for the incident on to us.\r\n   Meanwhile, they have massed a large group of warships on the extension line of the military demarcation line at the west sea to continue infiltrating them into the north side's territorial waters, fuelling the military tension.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In provoking such shocking incident the South Korean authorities seek to mislead public opinion at home and abroad and divert elsewhere the people's attention and thus to tide over their ruling crisis.\r\n   They must no longer make a mockery of public opinion, but apologize for these grave provocations and take full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A signed commentary of Minju Joson warns that the U.S. and the South Korean rulers should stop acting rashly, properly judging the decisive determination and will of the Korean people and people's army. \r\n\r\n"

It is his intention that our ideological work should be to thoroughly arm the popular masses with the socialist idea,  firmly build up the socialist ideological positioning all the fields of revolution and construction and bring the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative ingenuity of the masses into full play.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  His wise leadership also can be found in the fact that he has developed the people's army into one with strong ideology and faith and made its spirit and traits prevalent throughout the country.   He has also categorically rejected the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning.   No matter how desperately the imperialists may try to infuse ideas of bourgeois liberalization into our ranks, our socialist ideological position is impregnable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our ideological fortress is a strong bulwark of ideology and a fort of faith which have been built with the faith and will of our people to devotedly safeguard the respected Marshal Kim Jong Il. \r\n  \r\n"
