It is a symbol of disgrace with which the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation were trampled on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' dreaming of eternal domination over south Korea by building their embassy in this place is one more grave infringement upon the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation and an insult to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should resolutely smash the shameless moves of the U.S. imperialists to build the U.S. embassy in the Ryongsan base through the dynamic anti-U.S. struggle for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clearly understand that there is no one phyong of land to offer to the Yankees and should come to senses and promptly stop their anti-national action of leaving the inviolable territory of the country to the mercy of the foreign forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The history of the unity of our revolutionary ranks is characterized by the comradely trust and love. Herein lies its real significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il's trust in the army and people provides eternal dynamism and precious nutritive elements for their life and struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The leader reposes absolute trust in the servicepersons and people and the latter deeply trust and follow the former. These kindred ties have put the single-minded unity on a new higher level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity of our revolutionary ranks is demonstrating its might as unbreakable unity in idea and will as the people are rallied close around their leader in one idea and will and as an organized integral whole in which all of them move as one.\r\n The entire party and army and all the people in the DPRK breathe and move as one as intended by the party, cherishing Kim Jong Il's revolutionary idea as immutable truth and a maxim of their life and struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity of our revolutionary ranks is unbreakable as it has grown stronger thanks to their total dedication. The total dedication of the party and leader to the people and the latter's boundless devotion to the former produced the single-minded unity between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our single-minded ranks have become ranks of those who are determined to devotedly safeguard their leader and those based on genuine comradeship in which all their members help and lead each other forward. This unity has grown stronger as the spirit of serving the people prevails throughout the society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party devotes itself to the people and they uphold the party's leadership with utmost dedication and guidance and the masses are blended with each other like one organism. Herein lies an important factor of our unity remaining undeterred by any stern trial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This unity serves as a powerful treasured sword which helps increase the country's military capacity to be invincible and a mighty weapon for bringing about miraculous changes and prosperity in the Songun era. We should consolidate our single-minded unity based on the trust and devotion in hearty response to the party's slogan \"Let the Whole Party and Army and All the People Unite as One in Mind and More Strikingly Demonstrate the Might of Songun!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Immensely bright is the future of the Songun revolution which advances and emerges victorious thanks to the single-minded unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will always demonstrate their honor of being victors as they confidently advance along the orbit of Songun, rallied close around Kim Jong Il in single mind, no matter how the world may change and how the situation may develop.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an extremely arbitrary and high-handed practice and an outright challenge to the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world has become as turbulent and complicated as today entirely due to the U.S. moves for aggression and domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula has also deteriorated due to the U.S. hostile policy and reckless war moves against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable ambition of the U.S. to invade the DPRK and dominate Asia with the Korean Peninsula as a springboard and establish a global order of its domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about \"peace and human rights\" is nothing but a slogan for invading and dominating other countries and a subterfuge to cover up its criminal nature.
