While leading the anti-Japanese armed struggle to liberate the country from the Japanese  colonial rule, the President Kim Il Sung called an inaugural meeting of the association on May 5, Juche 25 (1936) and published \"the ten-point programme of the ARF,\" \"rules of the ARF \" and \"the inaugural declaration of the ARF\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ARF was the first general anti-Japanese united national front and a powerful underground revolutionary organization, for uniting as one all the anti-Japanese patriotic forces at home and abroad and ensuring a unified leadership over them.   With its foundation, the movement of the anti-Japanese united national front could develop more organizationally and systematically on a nationwide scale in close combination with the anti-Japanese armed struggle and the mass foundation for the revolution expand and strengthen  on a full scale.   It also made it possible to make more organized preparations for founding the party and expand its organization deep into the homeland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since its foundation the ARF had played a significant role in the struggle of the Korean people to liberate the country and achieve the victory of the revolution, performing enduring feats.   Indeed, the ARF was a brilliant fruition of President Kim Il Sung's Juche-oriented idea of great national unity and an immortal banner encouraging the entire fellow countrymen to the unity. \r\n\r\n"

Iraq and Yugoslavia  were chosen as its victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the U.S. strategy towards Europe to establish control over Europe taking hold of NATO.\r\n   Hence, the United States has organized and spearheaded the current NATO's  military strikes against Yugoslavia.\r\n   Military attack on Yugoslavia is also related to the political and economic crisis that has become worsened in the United States with each passing day.\r\n   The United States is wholly to blame for the tragic situation in Yugoslavia. \r\n  \r\n"

This bill sounds an alarm for what a perilous ambition the Japanese reactionaries have. Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today says:    The \"insurance of security in emergencies in surrounding areas \" on the lips of the Japanese reactionaries is an intrigue to cover up their true colors as aggressors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"Guidelines for Japan-U.S. defence Cooperation\" which were worked out in 1978 mainly provided for cooperation between the \"Self-Defence Forces\" and U.S. troops in case of a \"military attack\" on Japan. But the \"bill\" which was adopted this time stipulates that the scope of Japan-U.S. defence cooperation shall be drastically expanded into military actions to \"cope with emergencies in surrounding areas of Japan\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The above-mentioned \"surrounding areas of Japan\" include  vast areas in Asia and the pacific. This means, in fact, that all institutional machines have been made for the \"SDF\" to  come out for overseas aggression without a hitch on the pretext of \"cooperation\" with the U.S. forces and \"insurance of Japan's security.\"    The Japanese reactionaries are talking about Japan-U.S. Military cooperation in \"non-combat areas\" and \"rear\" but their proposed cooperation is little different from their participation in a modern war which rages both on the front and in the rear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They regard the DPRK as the first target of their overseas aggression.\r\n   We can never  tolerate the Japanese reactionaries' reckless moves to stifle the DPRK in collusion with the U.S. \r\n\r\n"

It went on:   The revolutionary history created by the great Kim Jong Il in the last 5 years  serves as treasures of eternal value in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This period is of great importance in the history of his revolutionary activities.\r\n   His revolutionary activities for the last more than 30 years are a glorious history  in which he had led the Korean revolution together with  President Kim Il Sung while the last five years are adorned with shining annals  in which he has pulled through  stern trials, shouldering upon himself all the heavy burdens of the country and the revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During this period he has undergone  all hardships that a revolutionary or a leader May suffer.\r\n   His revolutionary history is annals of total dedication and tireless efforts, which can be made only by a leader who is responsible for the destiny of the people.\r\n   In the last  unforgettable five years not only the Korean people but also the world people expressed deep admiration for his greatness and the spirit of Juche Korea startled the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK won victory in the confrontation with the imperialist allied forces over the \"nuclear suspicion,\"  successfully carried on the \"arduous march\" and forced march, solemnly proclaimed the start of the building of a powerful nation and fully demonstrated the might of the people single-heartedly united behind the party and the leader. This has created a great sensation in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The respected Kim Jong Il's greatness as a peerlessly great man with literary and military accomplishments and intense loyalty and filial piety and an able and tested veteran statesman of world stature is clearly proved by this stirring reality.\r\n   For having brilliantly decorated the closing years of the 1990s he is highly praised by the world revolutionary people as the \"great sun who will lead the 21st century.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the last 5 years the Korean people have keenly realized that it is the way of a worthy  life for a revolutionary to hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem  and deeply grasped  the truth that we can emerge ever-victorious when we do everything his way.\r\n   United around him, we can defeat any formidable enemy and occupy any fortress on the way of socialist construction. \r\nThis is the most valuable truth the Korean people have learned in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His revolutionary history serves as priceless treasures not only for the country and the nation but for humankind and  as a cornerstone of eternal value for the revolution. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Key to peace on Korean peninsula\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The 5th round of the four-way talks for peace on the Korean peninsula closed without any substantial progress, except the fixing of the date for the next talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    No progress has been made at the talks so far because the United States and South Korea persistently refused to discuss the most fundamental and essential issue of ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, the main objective of the talks but insisted on discussion on unessential and offbeat issue.   The DPRK has consistently called for withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea, and it is an undeniable, very just demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The key to peace on the Korean peninsula is to get the U.S. forces withdrawn from South Korea.    Korea was divided into north and south and underwent a tragic war in the 1950s, owing to the illegal military occupation of the south by the U.S. troops. It is also due to the U.S. forces present in South Korea that political and military confrontation has persisted and escalated in the state of an unstable cease-fire and a potential danger of a new war remains in Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    After Japan's defeat in August 1945, the United States shipped its troops into South Korea under the pretext of disarming the Japanese troops in September.  But at that time the anti-Japanese war was already over and no Japanese army remained in South Korea to be disarmed. It was a historic fact and, accordingly the U.S. troops' stationing in South Korea was illegal from its start and they were not \"liberators\" but aggressors who replaced the Japanese imperialists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The withdrawal of the U.S. troops is stipulated in the Korean armistice agreement signed between the DPRK and the United States but the latter has violated the agreement and torpedoed its implementation systematically till now.    For example, the U.S. and South Korea signed a \"mutual defense treaty,\" which is used as a playing card to refuse the discussion of the issue of U.S. forces' withdrawal from South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The treaty, concluded just after the Korean cease-fire, is an aggressive and treacherous treaty intended to annul the armistice agreement and provoke another war of aggression.    It is an established fact that under the treaty the U.S. troops in South Korea have aggravated the situation on the Korean peninsula through war maneuvers of various forms and armed provocation's against the DPRK since the Korean war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    This clearly shows that the U.S. troops present in South Korea are a source of a war on the Korean peninsula and a main obstacle to its peaceful reunification.\r\n    All the facts evidently prove that it is no more than an armchair argument to discuss the issue of ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, apart from the U.S. troops' withdrawal, which is the fundamental and essential issue. \r\n\r\n"

What was the gravest was his call for \"strike at hardcore target in the north\" made in a \"report on policy reform of the defence ministry.\"\r\n   This is very serious and unpardonable, bellicose utterances fuelling inter-Korean military confrontation and driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to a phase of crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"provocation through southward infiltration\" is no more than a hypocritical, false propaganda of the South Korean war hawks intended to justify their anti-north war moves. In other words, it is a subterfuge to justify their possible surprise \"strike\" at the north.   It is not fortuitous that Chon called for \"strike\" against the north when the U.S.-led NATO was escalating air raids on Yugoslavia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe war hawks seek to make a preemptive strike against the DPRK with the Asian-style \"NATO\" based on the U.S.-Japan-South Korea military alliance as NATO attacks Yugoslavia in Europe. It is as clear as noonday that their argument about \"strike against hardcore target\" came from such criminal intention to contain the DPRK by \"force.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To counter \"strike\" with strike is the unshakable will and determination of the people and servicemen of the DPRK.\r\nOur strong retaliatory strike will lead those war hawks to destruction. \r\n\r\n"
