And it employed every possible gimmick to shun the DPRK proposal for joint verification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this connection the DPRK side repeatedly questioned the U.S. forces side whether it intends to overturn even the agreed agenda item on probing the truth about the \"Cheonan\" case, why it is afraid of conducting a joint investigation into the controversial evidence while trumpeting about \"results\" of the scientific and objective \"joint investigation\" and why it refuses to accept the said proposal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, the U.S. forces side failed to give any answer to those questions, only uttering that these questions are not in line with the nature of the contact. And it made a clumsy excuse, asserting that it is not in a position to give any answer to this proposal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the attitude shown by the U.S. forces side at the seven rounds of the contact made till now proves that the \"Cheonan\" case has nothing to do with the DPRK, its side continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for the U.S. forces side to respond to the joint verification or advance any alternative offer for settling the issue and if it has no intention to do so, it should make assurances that it will not blame the DPRK any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a limit to the patience of the army and people of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. forces side refuses to meet this last demand of the DPRK, the DPRK side will have no option but to bring to light the true nature of the charade orchestrated by the U.S. and the south Korean group of traitors."

Kumgang Reunion Centre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the end, the south side went the lengths of suggesting to discuss the matter at the next round of the talks, openly shunning the discussion on the matter itself. It insisted on opening the next round of the talks late in November, delaying the date of opening the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis proves that the south side came out for the talks under the pressure of public opinion at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe stand of the south side, in the final analysis, clearly proved that it, in fact, has no intention to settle the issue of the reunion of separated families and relatives, revitalize the humanitarian work and settle the overall inter-Korean relations, while paying lip-service to the solution of the humanitarian issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK side warned the south side that if it, persisting in its insincere approach, lays a hurdle in the humanitarian work and shuns the process to improve the inter-Korean relations, the DPRK will be compelled to reconsider the sincere proposals and measures made so far to find solution to humanitarian issues and whether or not the reunion of separated families and relatives is let to go on will entirely depend on the attitude of the south side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the talks both sides agreed to further the discussion on the pending issues of mutual concern as regards the Red Cross humanitarian work between the north and the south. It was agreed to have the next round of talks on Nov. 25 and fix their venue later."

chino Mao Zedong enviaron al frente coreano el CVPCh organizado por los mejores hijos del pueblo chino bajo la bandera de \"resistir a los yanquis, ayudar a Corea, y defender el hogar y el pais propios\" y ayudaron con la sangre la justa lucha del pueblo coreano, senalo y subrayo que el partido y el pueblo chinos dieron la sincera ayuda material y espiritual al pueblo coreano aun en las

y el pueblo de Corea no olvidan para siempre las proezas heroicas de ellos quines lucharon con valentia derramando sangre en las montanas y campos de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Apunto que heredar bien y desarrollar la invencible amistad Corea-China establecida con la sangre en la lucha por la independencia antiimperialista y el socialismo y heredada como la valiosa riqueza por los dirigentes
