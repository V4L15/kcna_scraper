The statement accused the U.S. of seeking through its war against Iraq to aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula and tighten its grip on South Korea and maintain its unchallenged domination over northeast Asia. It urged the South Korean authorities to drop their humiliating and servile military diplomatic policy towards the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south headquarters of the national alliance of youth and students for the country's reunification in a statement issued on Sept. 18 strongly demanded the South Korean authorities retract their sycophantic plan to support the U.S. in its war against Iraq, noting that the military moves staged by the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula prove that the war against Iraq may spill over straight into the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"
