All the enemy's administrative organs were in flames, which resembled a gigantic torch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The flames of Pochonbo, which instilled into the Korean people the hope for national restoration, were a manifestation of the national spirit that no enemy can avoid its ruin if it dared provoke Korea, a revelation of national dignity that no one can enslave the Korean nation and a declaration of the President's strong will that the victory is sure to come when the Korean nation is firmly united against the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This great truth has been steadily proved along with the development of the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people accomplished the cause of national liberation by defeating the Japanese imperialists in 1945 and defeated the armed invasion upon the young DPRK made by the U.S. imperialists in the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They inflicted shameful defeats upon the U.S. imperialists whenever the latter had made provocations like the Pueblo incident, Panmunjom incident and large spy plane EC-121 incident against the DPRK.

And in the 1990s it promised to help Israel tackle the international pressure on its nuclear weaponization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an ill logic that the U.S. and its allies' missile launches are \"conducive\" to preserving peace and security but the DPRK's missile test-fire is a \"provocation\" that escalates tensions doesn't make sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one is entitled to find fault with the DPRK's exercise of just rights to self-defence to protect the sovereignty and vital rights."

Washington is also mulling increasing the attack capabilities through the drill of dropping GBU-12.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is blustering that it would increase the number of the launching tubes of Virginia-class nuclear subs to 40 from 12 to treble their ground attack capabilities and that it would maximize the combat capabilities of Stealth destroyer Zumwalt in a short period for its deployment in the waters off south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It gets vociferous, saying that the \"improvement of attack capabilities of strategic assets would bring more effective military pressure on the north\" and \"they would display great might in attacking the coastal areas of the north in case of emergency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the U.S. remains unchanged in its sordid intention to stifle the DPRK by force, hold a military edge in Asia-Pacific and thus realize without fail its ambition for world domination, and that it is none other than the U.S. which is rendering the situation on the peninsula and the region extremely tense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the long history of DPRK-U.S. stand-off we are well aware of the crafty nature of the U.S. which always watches for a chance for launching invasion while spurring the preparations for it behind its peace propaganda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nuclear weapons was the best strategic option for defending the destiny and sovereignty of the country and preserving peace of the region in the face of the U.S. hideous hostile policy toward the DPRK and its nuclear threat and blackmail that has lasted decade after decade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its most powerful nuclear deterrence provided a powerful guarantee for putting an eternal end to the danger of outsiders' aggression and war and ensuring the bright future of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, a peace-loving socialist country, values and loves peace more than others but is neither afraid of nor is going to evade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is at issue is that the U.S. high-ranking authorities have become frantic in their arms buildup, while letting out a spate of rhetoric that \"it would neither seek a regime change in the north nor invade it but would ensure its system\" and \"war with the north would bring disaster\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will neither loosen its vigilance nor lay down its arms, being taken in by a few rhetoric of the U.S. Its army and people will not make a concession in bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self-defence, the critical option, being taken in by the crafty trick of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. bluffing targeting weak countries without nuclear weapons will not work on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is escalating the useless military stand-off, failing to face up to the situation.
