They are set to step up the nuclear weaponization under the pretext of coping with the non-existent \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK. Japan developed long-range missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads already long ago. Its huge military spending every year is aimed at emerging a military power and having access to nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists have a sinister intention to possess nuclear weapons and use them for realizing their ambition for dominating Asia at any cost. Herein lie the gravity and danger of their moves for nuclear weaponization. The United States brought nuclear disasters to Asia in the last century and this danger is likely to be created by Japan in the present century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean and other Asian peoples are following Japan's moves to go nuclear with a high degree of vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Japanese reactionaries persistently keep to the road of nuclear weaponization and nuclear war, oblivious of the lesson taught by the past history, they will only meet an irretrievable disaster and destruction.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops answered to this by replacing the previous firing range with another one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The removal of the firing range to Jik Islet is allegedly to step up military exercises of aggression with it as a base and force the south Korean people to undergo misfortune and sufferings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unpardonable treachery for the south Korean authorities to submit to the U.S. demand and offer a sacred land of the country as a military drill ground of the aggression forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This history is shining as a noble example in the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S struggle in our era. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic source of the WPK and the background against which it was founded are associated with the anti-imperialist struggle and it came into being on the basis of the solution of all issues related to the building of the party including its guiding idea and core in the crucible of the anti-imperialist struggle. Herein lie the might and characteristic feature of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six decade-long history of the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle waged by the WPK since its foundation is the course of a heroic struggle in which it has stood the most rigorous test of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK experienced the three year-long fierce Fatherland Liberation War fought against the U.S. imperialists, boss of imperialism and chieftain of world reaction, and stood in confrontation without gunfire with the U.S. for decades. It was none other than the WPK that stood on the forefront of the fiercest anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle in the 20th century and it is leading the cause of independence against imperialism in this century, too. \r\n The WPK is an iron-willed vanguard contingent which has led the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle to victory with Juche-oriented conviction and will and a seasoned staff which has always emerged victorious in the above-said struggle on the basis of the most scientific and revolutionary strategies and tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a guardian of justice as it has consistently adhered to the revolutionary principle in the whole course of that struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said history is a history of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il who firmly protected the destiny of the country and people in a responsible manner and a history of the outstanding great men who brought about victories with rare wisdom and strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reviewing with pride the WPK's 60 year-long history in which it has set an epoch-making example in the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle, the army and people of the DPRK renew their unshakable determination to dynamically advance along the path of independence against imperialism under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il.      \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities Urged to Join in Movement for Pullout of U.S. Forces \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. forces side whisked away the GI who drove his truck over a south Korean woman to death in Tongduchon, Kyonggi Province on June 10 this year, letting him go unpunished, asserting that \"he did nothing wrong\". \r\n This was a clear proof that the U.S. forces regard the south Korean people as mere colonial slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Sunday said this in a signed commentary. It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the same killing as the murder of Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son is bound to continue in south Korea as long as the beast-like U.S. imperialists remain there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality calls on the south Korean people to intensify the struggle to drive the U.S. troops out of south Korea.  South Koreans will no longer fall victim to the atrocities of the U.S. troops only when their anti-U.S. candle-light demonstrations rage throughout south Korea just as they took place three years back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the recent case is concerned, the south Korean authorities were also humiliated by the U.S. forces side under the eyes of the world. It was already known that the south Korean authorities asked it to hand the jurisdiction over cases of GI crimes to them against the backdrop of the mounting anti-U.S. actions of the south Korean people. But the U.S. forces side did not let an ear to this request. It was not until late in August nearly three months after the occurrence of the murder that it claimed it would exercise the jurisdiction over the case as it occurred while he was performing his duty. So the U.S. forces side neither tried him nor punished the criminal after turning down the request of the south Korean authorities. This is the real picture of the south Korea-U.S. alliance. One will never dodge such bitter despise and shame as long as one regards the U.S. as one's savior and serves it.  \r\n Even under this situation, is there any justification to let the U.S. imperialist aggression forces stay in south Korea who have brought such misfortune and pain to the Korean nation? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should join the people in their actions for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu\" and \"Winter in River Nam\" were awarded gold prizes, the highest prize at the 8th Beijing International Art Exhibition. These art works evoked lively response among world painters. \r\n \"Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu\" was done by Kim Il Sung Prize Winner and People's Artist Son U Yong of the Korean Painting Creative Group of the Mansudae Art Studio. It truthfully depicts the majestic and spectacular scenery of peaks and the shore of Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu. It is a sacred mountain of the Korean revolution associated with the immortal feats of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il and  Kim Jong Suk, the three generals of Mt. Paektu. It is a truthful portrayal of the scenic beauty of the lake including clear wave on Lake Chon and pumice stone spread on its shore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Winter in River Nam\" was done by Kim Il Sung Prize Winner and People's Artist Jong Chang Mo of the Korean Painting Creative Group of the Mansudae Art Studio. It depicts the winter scenery of River Nam against the background of Mt. Kumgang, a famous mountain of Korea. Life-like in its description and profound in the painter's sentiment, the river depicted on the painting seems to flow, conveying the patriotic devotion displayed by servicemen and women of the village during the period of the Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The painting looks so truthful that visitors feel as if they were hearing the water of the river to steadily flow though it is covered with snow and its sides still remain frozen and migrating birds to chirp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Labour Hero and Merited Artist Kim Tong Hwan, chief of the Group, told KCNA that both paintings are a harmonious combination of traditional drawing methods and colors suited to the modern aesthetic taste as the method of using distinct lines, a traditional method applied to Korean paintings, was skillfully used in the first painting and the second painting was based on single stroke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These paintings based on socialist realism are mainly characterized by the fact that ink lines were effectively used and there is a harmonious and striking contrast among different colors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They prove the validity and vitality of Kim Jong Il's policy for developing color Korean paintings with main emphasis on coloring.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
