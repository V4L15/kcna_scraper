Only when a country holds fast to the ideological work can it augment its political and ideological might in every way and surely emerge victorious in the acute political and ideological confrontation with imperialism, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Degeneration under socialism begins with the degeneration of idea. When the ideological front gets disintegrated, it leads to the collapse of all fronts of socialism and to the complete fall of socialism in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic way of winning victory in the political and ideological confrontation with imperialism to achieve the politico-ideological unity of the socialist society and strengthen and develop the social relations under socialism based on the comradely unity and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are now frantically conducting the psychological warfare to break the political and ideological unity and comradely relations in socialist countries. Through this they seek to destabilize the socialist countries politically and ideologically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If socialism is to emerge victorious in the confrontation with imperialism, it is necessary to achieve the cohesion and unity of the society and give full play to the united strength and wisdom of the popular masses.  Herein lie the advantages of socialism and its invincible might. And they are guaranteed by the ideological work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important condition for winning a victory in the political and ideological confrontation with imperialism to protect socialist properties and steadily consolidate and develop the socialist economic relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The working class party should have a firm grip on media, literature and arts and other ideological and cultural means and steadily increase their roles to make sure that all ideological and cultural means creditably carry out their mission and duty on the socialist ideological front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A socialist state should guide and manage all fabrics of social life in conformity with the socialist principle and requirements. This plays a great function in encouraging the people in their efforts to consolidate the socialist idea and make their life under socialism joyful and worthwhile. This provides an important guarantee for preventing outdated ideas from reviving and these ideas from infiltrating from outside in the socialist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is immutable truth that it is possible to consolidate the socialist political and ideological position and achieve the victorious advance of the socialist cause only when the ideological work is pushed ahead of all other matters in the socialist society with top priority given to ideology. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

An important factor of achieving successes in this work is to effectively tap and use human, material, technological and financial potentials of the countries and make sure that the bulk of efforts for socio-economic life are directed to settling the food and agricultural problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for the non-aligned and other developing countries to reform the outdated socio-economic structure built by the colonialists in the past as required by the building of independent national economy. It is imperative to reform and develop the rural economy that had been shaped in favor of the imperialists only in such a way as to suit their specific conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These countries should further strengthen South-South cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance.
