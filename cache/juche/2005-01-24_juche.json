Such stratagem can never work with the DPRK, even though it may go with other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If vigilance is dulled against such U.S. moves, they may bring no less serious consequences than open military aggression.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Pueblo\" Incident Reveals U.S. Brazenness\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- January 23, 1968 was one of the ignominious days for the United States, which was boasting of being a \"super power\".\r\n That day the U.S. armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" was captured by the Navy of the Korean People's Army in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was condemned by world public for the shocking incident. It, however, had the effrontery to misinform the world public about the incident and present a military threat to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  But the DPRK took a firm stand to answer retaliation with retaliation and counter a total war with a total war. In December 1968 the U.S. could not but sign a document in which the U.S. government apologized to the DPRK for the reconnaissance and promised not to allow any ship of the U.S. to enter the DPRK's territorial water again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The incident gave a serious lesson to the arrogant U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is lost to shame, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hardly the ink of its signature to the document became dry when the U.S. reconnaissance plane EC-121 (in April 1969) and a helicopter OAH-23G (in August 1969) entered the territorial air of the DPRK for the purpose of reconnaissance but were shot down by the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. committed hostile acts against the DPRK on over 10,000 occasions in violation of the Armistice Agreement in 1969 alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past three decades since the year, the U.S. has continued anti-DPRK provocations on the ground and sea and in air, typical of them being the West Sea incident in February 1974, the East Sea incident in June 1974 and the Panmunjom shooting incident in November 1984. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years it worked out such nuclear war plans against the DPRK as \"New Operation Plan 5026\" and \"Operation Plan 5027-04\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But all of them are sure to meet failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to draw a proper lesson from the \"Pueblo\" incident.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
