            "content": "Japanese Political Circles' Turn to Right under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 14 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday carries a signed commentary denouncing the Japanese political circles for veering to the Right and stepping up militarization.\r\n Recalling that Abe, chief cabinet secretary of the new Cabinet, described the present chief executive's visit to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" as the one for praying for the souls of those who died for the country, while zealously supporting the visit, the news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No rhetoric can cover up the criminal nature of the Japanese chief executive's visit to the shrine. His visit to the shrine precisely means an undisguised denial of the crime-woven past of Japan and is little short of inciting the militarist idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is becoming evermore undisguised in its moves to distort and beautify the crimes it committed in the past and evade its responsibility for them. Heavyweights of political circles in Japan are vying with each other to let loose outbursts beautifying and totally negating its crime-woven past. Worst of them is Ishihara, Tokyo Metropolitan governor who has made himself infamous as an ultra-right politician. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, addressing a seminar held in Washington, negated the Nanjing massacre committed by the Japanese imperialists.\r\n Then, did he have any scientific ground to negate it? No, he had nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that there are not a few politicians such as Ishihara. It is not an exaggeration that the Japanese political camp has almost turned to the Right and militarism. Abe's remarks defending the Japanese chief executive's visit to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" and Ishihara's assertion openly negating the Nanjing massacre are, in fact, a miniature of the present political camp in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's turn to the Right leads to the militarization of the Japanese society. The real purpose sought by the right-wing reactionaries in the Japanese political circles in their moves to beautify the crime-woven past of the Japanese imperialists and their visits to the shrine is aimed at speeding up the militarization of the Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community should be alerted by Japan's turn to the Right and militarism. If they fail to follow what is going on in Japan with a high degree of vigilance, no one can predict what sort of disaster will befall Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are closely following Japan's turn to the Right and militarism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"New Right\", Variety of Ultra-rightist Conservatives \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 14 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary brands the \"National League of New Right\" framed up in south Korea on Nov. 7 as a variety of ultra-right conservative bodies in the U.S.\r\n The establishment of the league reflects the last-ditch effort of the pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea to get rid of the crisis of ruin, much upset by the vigorous advance of the June 15 era for reunification and the south Korean social trend toward progressive reform, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic trend of south Korean society to achieve independence against the U.S., national reunification and progressive reform. Old conservative forces going against the trend are going downhill with each passing day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The growing struggle of south Korean people from all walks of life for a probe into the truth behind the past history and for withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea has already sentenced all the leftovers of the Cold War era including the conservative forces to death  The organization of the league clearly proves that the reactionary advance of those forces challenging south Korean social progress and national reunification has reached the last-ditch bid. They have set out to make a coup-like operation looking forward to the 2007 \"presidential election\". This is clearly proved by the GNP and other conservative opposition party charlatans' action of peeping over the league. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nature of those with the old way of thinking will never change no matter how many times they may rename themselves. The south Korean people aspiring after national reunification and prosperity and social progress should turn out in a dynamic struggle to disclose and foil the dirty conspiratorial moves of the right-wing conservative forces hastening under the signboard of the \"new right.\"    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reality requires the Korean nation to wage a vigorous struggle to materialize cooperation under the banner of the three forms of cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the Korean nation puts the idea of \"By our nation itself\" into practice in hearty response to it can the nation pave the wide avenue for the victory of the movement for national reunification despite the desperate moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad. \r\n All the fellow countrymen at home and abroad will wage a more dynamic struggle to realize the three forms of cooperation, bearing deep in mind the noble idea of independent national reunification, \"By our nation itself\".     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
