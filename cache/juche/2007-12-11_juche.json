            "content": "Crime-Woven Career of Ri Hoe Chang Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute released an indictment on December 9 branding traitor Ri Hoe Chang as a fascist man-killer, separatist and confrontational maniac, kingpin of irregularities and corruption and human scum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Ri Hoe Chang inherited this disposition as a human butcher from his father, the indictment disclosed his atrocities as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Hoe Chang fabricated many \"cases of collaboration with communists\" to judge guiltless patriots and harshly punish them. They include the \"case of the federation of workers for national reunification and democracy\", \"case of the union of revolutionary workers for class struggle\", \"case of the group for the promotion of reunification of the country\", \"case of the group of activists for national liberation\", \"case of the Inchon committee of the socialist workers union\" and \"case of the socialist workers federation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His nature as a cruel human butcher was brought to spotlight when he was active as the justice of the Supreme Court during the period of Chun Doo Hwan's \"regime\" and the chairman of the \"Board of Audit and Inspection\" during the period of Kim Young Sam's dictatorial \"civilian government\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When military gangsters Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo were in prison, Ri Hoe Chang, whenever an opportunity presented itself, openly held that \"it would be good to settle the issue of granting amnesty to them as quickly as possible\" in a bid to set them free. He went the lengths of praising Park Chung Hee as \"the president who led the modernization\", Chun Doo Hwan as \"the president who realized the peaceful change of government for the first time in the history of the constitutional government\" and Roh Tae Woo as \"the president who paved the way for democratization\", while zealously patronizing and supporting them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts about how persistently traitor Ri has pursued division and confrontation, the indictment said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri's true colors as an anti-reunification element and a traitor found their vivid manifestation in his behavior during the historic 2000 inter-Korean summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was an event to be specially recorded in history but he dared let loose such outbursts terming it \"national disgrace\", \"a premature one\" and \"a step taken to serve the purpose of the north's tactics of united front\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Negating every paragraph of the June 15 joint declaration, he vociferated that \"there is no option but to achieve unification on the basis of liberal democracy and market economy\", \"one should not allow any action which may lead to the withdrawal of the U.S. forces\" and \"one should not allow the alliance with the U.S. to collapse.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traitor, when addressing a rally of ultra-right conservative organizations on October 24, cried out for blaming the authorities, arguing that \"the recent inter-Korean summit was a failure\" and what they behaved this time was an expression of \"typical submission and tribute to the north as they read its face\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has persistently opposed inter-Korean cooperation projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Steeped in the consciousness of confrontation between fellow countrymen to the marrow of his bones, he bitterly decried those projects and put a brake on them, ballyhooing about someone's \"opening\" and \"reciprocity\" and \"drain on resources\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His true colors as a separatist and confrontational maniac were brought into bolder relief by his behavior as regards the current \"presidential elections\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He at a \"press conference\" where he declared his \"presidential candidacy\" on November 7 talked rubbish critical of the policy pursued by the Grand National Party toward the north, the party which he once chaired. He jabbered that \"such policy of the GNP would never help bring about any change in the present inter-Korean relations and such regime change would be useless even if the GNP comes to power\". He went the lengths of blustering that he would \"leave the GNP and make redoubled efforts as a commoner\", urging the ultra-right conservatives to follow him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is a kingpin of irregularities and corruption in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To cite just a few, the cases of \"Anphung\", \"Sephung\" and \"Chongphung\" that created furor in the world were the political frauds, irregularities and corruption Ri committed in a bid to take the \"presidential office.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's scandal of \"illegal fund for presidential elections\" in 2003 was disclosed when Ri was \"president\" of the party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was involved in too many scams to enumerate, for example \"suspected evasion of the tax for a huge amount of commission and other taxes\", \"case of his son's evasion of military service\", \"case of suspected lobby for Keeyang Construction Co. Ltd\", \"case of super de luxe villa\" and \"scandal of real estate and illegal funds\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is making desperate efforts to realize his wild ambition for power under the patronage of his U.S. master, but the south Korean public turned its back on him long ago. What awaits him is only his grave.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Scientific Mariculture in Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has directed considerable efforts to putting mariculture on a scientific basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The marine ecological environment research group of Kim Il Sung University has made a great contribution to the scientific and technological support to mariculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group has defined right areas of the cultivation of sea products and suitable varieties, methods and density of culture in various areas of eastern and western coastal sea and marked off areas for the protection and propagation of marine resources. Meanwhile, it has studied and introduced feed organisms, assorted feed, feed additives, a water quality observation system of culture beds and so on suitable to the conditions of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this course, it has achieved noticeable successes in researches into the habitation of shell-fish in tideland and indoor cultivation of eel, abalone, sea cucumber, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Scallop cultivation beds in the shape of a well-bucket and sea tangle cultivation beds in the shape of large-sized frame hold a major share in the protection and propagation of marine resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Sinchang Mariculture Station has created a sea tangle cultivation bed in a place with high transparency and sufficient supply of nutritive salt. It produces large quantities of sea tangles by setting up tangle cultivation installations of float type in the upper layer and is increasing marine resources including sea cucumber, sea urchin and shell-fish by installing scallop cultivation devices of well-bucket shape in the middle layer and an artificial sea cucumber culture bed at the bottom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Raksan Mariculture Station is enhancing the effect of three-dimensional mixed cultivation, while preventing self-pollution, by propagating sea herbs in a scallop cultivation bed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those in the west coast tideland have built fish ponds to cultivate sea cucumber, sea jelly and other kinds of marine products by drawing sea water into them. They have also applied the technique of breeding fries of hard shell clam and short neck clam to the local conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the several fishery bases of the country, efforts are being made to breed high-yielding culture species by introducing various advanced sea culture methods.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Moves for Establishment of MD under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- Japan is busy establishing its own missile defence system (MD), organizing missile units and staging missile launching exercises of the Self-Defence Forces (SDF). This clearly proves that the Japanese militarists' scenario for reinvasion has reached a danger line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the establishment of the MD is one of the targets to which the Japanese reactionaries have attached particular importance and for whose attainment they have exerted so much effort in their arms buildup since the end of the Cold War, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For Japan, the MD means its armed forces' shift to an offensive system, far away from the conception of \"exclusive defence\". The introduction of MD would put Korea and other parts of Asia within the sphere of Japan's missile strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries regarded the establishment of the MD as one of the key elements in building up its offensive forces and began it with jointly developing the MD with the U.S. This is aimed at smoothly promoting the establishment of the MD as they wish, unhindered by their Constitution which bans the possession of any armed forces for war. In other words, they seek to pave the way for establishing their own MD under the signboard of the joint development of the system with the U.S. and thus push ahead with such moves in an undisguised manner. This scenario is now being put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the calculation of the Japanese reactionaries that they can beat any rival through preemptive attack and attain their purpose of war only if they have in place the MD system based on ultra-modern technology now that Japan is possessed of strong naval, air and ground offensive forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist forces intend to start reinvasion under the pretext of \"self-defence\" any moment. The DPRK is made the first target of their overseas aggression. This is evidenced by the assertion of the Japanese reactionaries that their moves for the establishment of the MD are aimed at coping with what they called \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are following with a high degree of vigilance the Japanese militarist forces rushing headlong into arms buildup and reinvasion, raising a hue and cry over the non-existent \"military threat\" from the DPRK. The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop going reckless in their moves for reinvasion, face up to the trend of the times and behave themselves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "IRP publica expediente criminal de Ri Hoe Chang \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 10 de diciembre (ATCC) -- El Instituto de la Reunificacion de la Patria (IRP) hizo publico el dia 9 un acta de acusacion que califica a Ri Hoe Chang de asesino fascista y maniaco de division, de confrontacion y de corrupto y desecho humano de peor calana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ri heredo de su padre el temperamento de asesino, adelanta la nota y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sobre todo, este traidor enjuicio y ejecuto brutalmente a los patriotas inocentes involucrados en los \"incidentes pro-comunistas\" inventados por el mismo como el \"caso de la Federacion Nacional de los Obreros por la Democracia y la Reunificacion\", \"caso de la Union de Lucha de Clase Obrera Revolucionaria\", \"asunto del Grupo por la Promocion de la Reunificacion de la Patria\", \"caso de Grupo de Activistas por la Liberacion Nacional\", \"caso del Comite de la Union de Obreros Socialistas en Inchon\", \"incidente de la Federacion de Obreros Socialistas\", etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   La naturaleza bestial de Ri fue mostrada plenamente cuando el trabajaba de juez de la Corte Suprema en el \"regimen\" de Chun Doo Hwan y de \"presidente\" del \"Consejo de Auditoria e Inspeccion\" en el \"gobierno\" de dictadura \"civil\" de Kim Young Sam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Cuando los gangsteres militares Chun Doo Hwan y Roh Thae Woo estaban encarcelados, Ri abogaba abiertamente por \"sellar el problema de indultar a Chun y Roh\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@De mal en peor, encomio a los tiranos fascistas y asesinos, a saber, a Park Chung Hee como \"presidente que condujo la modernizacion\", a Chun Doo Hwan como \"mandatario que logro por primera vez en la historia constitucional el cambio pacifico del poder\" y a Roh Thae Woo como \"gobernador que sento la base de democratizacion\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El renegado Ri persiguio obstinadamente la division y la confrontacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La naturaleza anti-reunificacion y antinacional de Ri se corroboro patentemente durante el historico encuentro cumbre Norte-Sur de 2000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@El se atrevio a calificar este evento de \"verguenza nacional\", \"cosa prematura\" y \"caida en la tactica del frente unido del Norte\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, al refutar articulo por articulo la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur del 15 de Junio, dijo que \"no hay otra variante que la reunificacion fundamentada en la democracia liberal y la economia del mercado\", \"es imperdonable la retirada de tropas estadounidenses del Sur de Corea\" y que \"no pueden destruir las relaciones de alianza con EE.UU\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@En un mitin de las entidades conservadoras ultraderechistas efectuado el 24 de octubre, el traidor Ri dijo que \"fracaso la reciente cumbre Norte-Sur\" calificandola de \"tipica sumision y tributacion al Norte\" y cacareo que \"imputaria la responsabilidad\" por el respecto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Ademas, ese partidario jurado de la confrontacion fratricida censura y frena los trabajos de cooperacion intercoreana calificandolos de \"asistencia desmesurada\" y condicionando la \"apertura\" de alguien y la \"reciprocidad\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La verdadera inclinacion ideologica de Ri, maniaco de division y enfrentamiento, se revelo nitidamente en visperas de las inminentes \"elecciones presidenciales\" en el Sur de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El 7 de noviembre, en una \"conferencia de prensa\" en que anuncio su \"candidatura presidencial\", comparo con \"aguas tibias\" la politica al Norte del \"Gran Partido Nacional\" (\"GPN\") que por algun tiempo fue presidido por el mismo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@A continuacion, peroro que el GPN \"no puede convertir con tal posicion las actuales relaciones con el Norte aunque asuma el poder y no se necesita el cambio del poder de este tipo\" y llamo a las \"fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas\" a seguirle prometiendoles salir del \"GPN\" y luchar hasta el fin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ri Hoe Chang esta conocido como el corrupto y ladron numero 1 en el Sur de Corea.\r\n  Los escandalos de raros nombres como \"Anphung\", \"Sephung\" y \"Chongphung\" fueron fraudes politicos y actos ilicitos cometidos por ese traidor para tomar la \"presidencia\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tambien, el \"incidente de fondos ilicitos para las elecciones presidenciales\" del \"GPN\" de 2003 fue desatado precisamente cuando Ri era su \"presidente\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Son incontables tales casos ilicitos, entre otros, el de \"alta cuota y sospechas de evasion del impuesto\", el \"de irregularidades en el problema de servicio militar del hijo de Ri\", el \"de las sospechas de lobby para la compania de construccion Keeyang\", el \"de la villa superlujosa\", el \"de bienes inmuebles y fondos secretos ilicitos\", etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El documento finaliza que aunque Ri Hoe Chang maniobra desesperadamente para realizar su ambicion por el poder bajo el amparo de su amo gringo, la opinion publica surcoreana lo abandono ya hace mucho tiempo y no le queda otro remedio que suicidarse.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
