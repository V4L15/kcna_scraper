            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects October 3 Dockyard under KPA Navy Unit 597\r\n Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, gave field guidance to the October 3 Dockyard under KPA Navy Unit 597 and set forth the task for its updating.\n\t\t\t\t\t There he looked round the monument to on-site guidance of the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu and rooms devoted to the education in revolutionary history and to the history of the dockyard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the historic mementoes and data, he recalled with deep emotion the course of development of the dockyard, which was built as the country's first base for warship repair in July 1947 at the instruction of President Kim Il Sung. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And he noted that when visiting the dockyard in the last year of his life, leader Kim Jong Il gave the important tasks that would serve as guidelines in operating it, underlining the importance of its duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the far-sighted wisdom of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the East and West Sea Fleets of the KPA Navy could have solid material and technical foundations whereby to repair any type of warship in a short period, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then the Supreme Commander went round the engine repair work-team, trial operation ground, dock, quay and other parts of the dockyard to learn in detail about the repairing of warships and working conditions and living environment of its employees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need for the dockyard to update its production processes in line with the requirement of the age of knowledge-based economy so as to successfully carry out the task of repairing warships and contribute to the modernization of warships. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed officials to give the dockyard a complete facelift to make its interior and exterior quite different from what they used to be as well as to build cultural and welfare establishments and a scientific and technological dissemination room in a perfect way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also said that the dockyard should be equipped with better sewage disposal facilities in conformity with the scientific and technological requirements to prevent the industrial waste water from polluting the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The October 3 Dockyard has a very important role to play in developing the navy, he said, and called for turning it into a model and standard dockyard in the country, adding that the party would solve all problems arising in doing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief that the dockyard would be successfully renovated on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the WPK to make a tangible contribution to the repair and modernization of various battleships and the development of the nation's shipbuilding industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Army Col.

In the 1960s it staged mad-cap Foal Eagle joint military exercises, constantly straining the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From 1976 the U.S. staged ill-famed Team Spirit and Ulji Focus Lens joint military drills, pushing the north-south relations to the phase of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also gradually expanded the scale and duration of the drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It committed military provocations including the armed conflict in the West Sea in 2002 one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK war drills that the enemies staged last year clearly prove how the U.S. has worked hard to block the improvement of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disclosing the fact that the U.S. moves have reached the extremity this year, the indictment continues:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example is the \"additional sanctions\" the Obama administration imposed on the DPRK under the pretext of hacking at the Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. puts pressure in every way on the puppet authorities to prevent them from holding dialogue despite its loud claim that it \"supports the north-south dialogue.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities which loudly claimed they were open to the north-south dialogue from the outset of the new year are making such poor sophism as \"unreasonable precondition of the north\", yielding to the U.S. pressure. This act aimed to shift the blame on to the DPRK side only to reveal their plight as a colonial stooge and henchman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., not content with this, viciously conducts smear campaign against the DPRK to incite hostility toward it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, from the outset of the new year the U.S. has been hell-bent on arms buildup and anti-DPRK war drills, deliberately straining the situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indictment continued as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should bear in mind the stern warnings issued by the arms of Mt. Paektu that it will be forced to drink a bitter cup of final destruction if it continues to pursue the anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and the aggression moves against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clarify whether it would open the road to the improvement of the north-south ties and reunification from the stand of By Our Nation Itself or continue war moves and the moves of inciting confrontation between social systems in collusion with the U.S. that is little short of bringing calamity upon themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persistently stands in the way of the improvement of the north-south ties and reunification of Korea while resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK, defying our warnings, it will be forced to pay a very high price for all the crimes it committed throughout history."
