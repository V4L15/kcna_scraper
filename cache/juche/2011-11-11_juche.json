            "content": "DPRK, U.S. Militaries Agree to Resume Excavation of GIs' Remains\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, November 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Friday as regards the story concerning the excavation of GIs' remains in the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK-U.S. military talks were held in Thailand's capital Bangkok from Oct. 18 to 20 to resolve the issue of GIs' remains in the DPRK at the request of the U.S. side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresent there were the KPA delegation led by Pak Rim Su, chief of the Panmunjom Mission, and the U.S. military delegation led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert J. Newberry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK side re-clarified the invariable humanitarian stand of the KPA side. The U.S. side admitted that it unilaterally suspended the excavation of GIs' remains, a project that had been successfully under way for the past decade, to serve its political purposes and assured that it would never abuse the project again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBroad discussion on the agenda items of mutual concern including bilateral humanitarian issues was made at the talks. Both sides agreed to resume the excavation of GIs' remains from 2012 as an immediate step and further the project."

            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Fish Farm Managed by Kim Jong Hwan\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, November 11 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, provided field guidance to the fish farm managed by Kim Jong Hwan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe looked round gravity-fed river pond, fry pond, fish pond, a hatchery and other places of the farm to learn about the fish breeding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe watched with satisfaction for a long time the shoals of fishes as big as forearm sailing in the pond.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter acquainting himself again with the doubled production in the pond with fishes growing faster than in other ponds as their metabolism is promoted when going upstream, he said this method deserves to be popularized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed again great satisfaction over the fact that employees of the farm spruced up the fishing ground in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and bred plenty of fishes, thereby making positive contribution to improving the people's diet. He highly appreciated their devoted service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said the people can actually benefit from the farm as it is not only situated in the right area rich in source of quality water and good in breeding but is equipped with sufficient facilities needed for fish production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter looking round the farm, he advanced tasks in breeding more fishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFish farming is cost-effective and highly profitable field, he said, adding this is also the most rapid way for supplying the people with fresh fishes in all seasons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is necessary to positively study, develop and introduce good breeds which grow fast while eating less feed, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFish farming should be put on a scientific, intensive and industrial basis. It is essential to solve the scientific and technological problems in the field of fish farming from the Juche stand and, at the same time, steadily enhance the role of feeders and technicians, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed expectation and belief that the officials and employees of the farm would rapidly increase the fish production and thus make positive contribution to realizing the desire of President Kim Il Sung who was considerate of supplying the people with abundant fishes in his lifetime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il was accompanied by Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, and Han Kwang Sang, first vice department director of the C.C., the WPK."
