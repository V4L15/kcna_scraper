            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Strategic Ballistic Rocket Launching Drill of KPA Strategic Force\r\n Pyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, guided an intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket launching drill of the KPA Strategic Force on the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t The drill was observed by senior officials of the Central Committee of the WPK including Ri Pyong Chol, Kim Jong Sik, Jo Yong Won and Yu Jin, and officials in the field of defence scientific research including Jang Chang Ha and Jon Il Ho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was greeted by commanding officers of the KPA Strategic Force including its General Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the KPA Strategic Force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Involved in the drill were Hwasong artillery units of the KPA Strategic Force tasked with striking the bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces located in the Pacific operational theater in contingency and intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known to the world, the intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket launching drill of the KPA Strategic Force was conducted as a part of the muscle-flexing to counter the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drills the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces finally kicked off in disregard of the DPRK's meaningful and crucial warning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drill was carried out through the combination of sudden maneuvers and strike in order to estimate and examine the posture of the KPA Strategic Force for prompt counteraction in contingency on the Korean peninsula and to confirm the actual war operation capacity of the intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket newly equipped with by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Hwasong artillery personnel, who were to conduct the launching drill for the first time in the capital city of the DPRK by order of Kim Jong Un, were all filled with strong militant enthusiasm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un arrived at the launching ground early at dawn and watched the artillerymen promptly moving and deploying the Hwasong-12 rocket launcher, praising them for their smart and accurate movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned in detail about the launch plan, preset flight track and target waters and issued an order to launch the rocket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fired ballistic rocket reflecting the dignity and might of the Juche-based nuclear power crossed the sky above Oshima peninsula of Hokkaido and Cape Erimo of Japan along the preset flight track and accurately hit the preset target waters in northern Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drill had no impact on the security of the neighboring countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the drill the rocket operational capacity of the Hwasong artillery units of the KPA Strategic Force for an actual war and the combat efficiency of the newly equipped intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket were all proved perfect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un expressed great satisfaction over the successful launching.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising the Hwasong artillerymen of the Strategic Force for being well versed in the newly equipped ultra-modern rocket system and properly operating it, he said the drill would offer them an opportunity for gaining a good experience in their rocket operation for an actual war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the current ballistic rocket launching drill like a real war is the first step of the military operation of the KPA in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam, advanced base of invasion, he said that it is necessary to positively push forward the work for putting the strategic force on a modern basis by conducting more ballistic rocket launching drills with the Pacific as a target in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sternly saying that the U.S. answered the DPRK's warning which it will closely watch the U.S. behavior with the bellicose war exercises for aggression, he added that the drill conducted by the Strategic Force is a curtain-raiser of its resolute countermeasures against the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises being conducted by the U.S. and its stooges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is a lesson drew by the DPRK this time again that it should show action, not talk, to the U.S. imprudently denying the DPRK's initiative measure for easing the extreme tension, he stressed that the DPRK will continue to watch the U.S. demeanors as already declared and decide its future action according to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great belief and conviction that the officers and men of the Strategic Force will further strengthen the combat preparations of Hwasong artillery pieces as required by the grim situation, be fully ready to go into action for decisive battle so as to launch powerful ballistic rockets anytime and thus check military racket of the U.S. imperialists and their followers and firmly guarantee the security of the country and the happiness of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officers and men of the KPA Strategic Force extended the warmest thanks to Kim Jong Un, peerless patriot and hero of the nation, who gave vent to the long-pent grudge of the Korean people by mapping out a bold plan to make the cruel Japanese islanders insensible on bloody Aug. 29 when the disgraceful \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" was proclaimed 107 years ago and approving ballistic rocket launching in the capital region, and pledged that once the Party Central Committee issues an order, they will fulfill their sacred mission and duty as the reliable nuclear force of the WPK in the van of the final sacred war which will win victory in the standoff with imperialism and the U.S."

Korean Chief Executive's \"Peace Rhetoric\"\r\n Pyongyang August 30 (KCNA) -- DPRK Leading newspapers Wednesday carry articles laying bare the \"peace rhetoric\" touted by the south Korean chief executive. \n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive let out a spate of \"peace rhetoric\", besmirching the public opinion, but the situation goes to clearly prove that this is no more than sophism to cover up the criminal scenario to ignite a war against the north in collusion with the U.S., says Rodong Sinmun in an article Wednesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  \"Peace rhetoric\" touted by the south Korean chief executive is the foolish action to put the mask of peace upon his master U.S. bringing the disaster of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And this is a chicanery to cover up his sinister intention to do harm to the DPRK by force of arms, backed by his master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If he sincerely wants peace, he should take up the cudgel against the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and provocation of nuclear war against the latter, not fault the nuclear deterrent for self-defense of the compatriots which guarantees peace on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop foolish action to deceive public opinion at home and abroad through the \"peace rhetoric,\" and make the decision to throw off the yoke of a war against the north shouldered by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula requires the south Korean authorities to make a proper policy decision at the crossroads of peace or war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says in a commentary that they should not try to deceive the public opinion at home and abroad with the sugar-coated \"peace rhetoric\" but make efforts to ward off the U.S. nuclear war, boldly discarding the policy of kowtowing to the U.S."

del Comite de Estado de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea, dirigio sobre el terreno el entrenamiento de lanzamiento del cohete balistico estrategico de alcance mediano y largo de las fuerzas estrategicas del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo presenciaron Ri Phyong Chol, Kim Jong Sik, Jo Yong Won, Uyu Jin y otros cuadros directivos del Comite Central del PTC, Jang Chang Ha, Jon Il Ho y otros funcionarios del dominio de investigacion de ciencias de defensa nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el terreno el Maximo Dirigente fue acogido por el general de ejercito Kim Rak Gyom, comandante de las fuerzas estrategicas del EPC, y otros miembros de mando.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el ejercicio se movilizaron las unidades artilleras Hwasong de las fuerzas estrategicas,  que se encargan del deber de atacar las bases de las tropas agresoras yanquis en la zona operacional de Oceano Pacifico, y el chote balistico estrategico de alcance mediano y largo \"Hwasong-12\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como esta conocido por todo el mundo, este entrenamiento se realizo como un eslabon de manifestacion de las fuerzas armadas frente al ejercicio militar conjunto Ulji Freedom Guardian que se efectua por fin pese a nuestra advertencia de significado importante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejercicio de lanzamiento se realizo en combinacion con la movilidad y ataque inesperados para juzgar e inspeccionar el estado de  reaccion rapida de nuestras fuerzas armadas estrategicas para el tiempo de emergencia de la Peninsula Coreana y confirmar la capacidad de administracion practica del cohete balistico estrategico de alcance mediano y largo, equipado nuevamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun la orden del Comandante Supremo, los artilleros Hwasong realzan por primera vez el ejercicio de lanzamiento en la capital de nuestro Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Comandante Supremo quien llego a la madrugada al lugar de lanzamiento en la oscuridad, observo los movimientos de manejo del cohete de los artilleros que despliegan con rapidez la plataforma de lanzamiento del cohete \"Hwasong-12\" y preparan el lanzamiento y elogio sus maniobras exactas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Maximo Dirigente averiguo detalladamente el plan de lanzamiento, la orbita de vuelo fijada, la zona maritima de blanco y otros y dio la orden de disparo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al momento, el \"Hwasong.12\" subio imponentemente demostrando la dignidad y el poderio de la potencia nuclear del Juche coloriendo de rojo al cielo de Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El cohete lanzado viajo segun la orbita de vuelo prevista cruzando el cielo de la peninsula Oshima de Hokkaido y el cabo Erimo de Japon y ataco con exactitud la zona maritima de blanco en el mar del Oceano Pacifico del Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este ejercicio no dio ninguna influencia a la seguridad de los paises vecinos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el ejercicio fue evaluada la perfeccion de la capacidad de administracion practica del cohete de la unidad artillera Hwasong de las fuerzas estrategicas y la eficiencia combativa del cohete balistico estrategico de alcance mediano y largo, equipado nuevamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Comandante Supremo expreso la gran satisfaccion de que se realizo exitosamente el lanzamiento del cohete \"Hwasong-12\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El dijo que los artilleros Hwasong dominaron el sistema del cohete equipado nuevamente y lo manejan bien y prosiguio que a traves de este ejercicio, adquirieran buenas experiencias en la administracion practica del cohete.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Indico que el presente ejercicio parecido al combate real es el primer paso de la operacion miliar en el Oceano Pacifico realizado por nuestro ejercito y deviene el preludio muy significativo para mantener a raya la isla Guam, base avanzada de la agresion, y subrayo la necesidad de realizar muchos ejercicios de lanzamiento del cohete balistico teniendo como blanco el Oceano Pacifico y acelerar activamente la conversion de las fuerzas armadas estrategicas en las fuerzas combativas, su preparacion para el combate real y su modernizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Dijo severamente que EE.UU. respondio con los belicosos ejercicios de guerra agresiva a nuestra advertencia de que observara la accion de EE.UU., y afirmo que este entrenamiento realizado por las fuerzas estrategicas es el preludio de la contramedida rotunda contra el simulacro conjunto Ulji Freedom Guardian que libran EE.UU. y sus lacayos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta vez volvio a sacar la leccion de que no debemos tratar caballerosamente con EE.UU. que actua descaradamente despreciando nuestras medidas iniciativas para aliviar la situacion extremada aguda, sino demostrar con la practica, senalo y continuo que como ya aclarado, seguira observando la habla y gesto de EE.UU. y segun eso decidira el acto futuro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Expreso gran esperanza y conviccion de que los oficiales y soldados de las fuerzas estrategicas fortalezcan aun mas la preparacion de batalla de artilleros Hwasong y preparen estrictamente la disposicion de combate capaz de lanzar en cualquier momento los poderosos cohetes balisticos para detener las maniobras militares de los imperialistas yanquis y sus seguidores y garantizar firmemente la seguridad de la patria y la felicidad del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los oficiales y soldados de las fuerzas estrategicas del EPC expresaron agradecimiento al Maximo Dirigente, patriota sin igual y heroe de la nacion, quien el 29 de agosto, dia ensangrentado de ser publicada hace 107 anos el infame tratado de anexion de Corea a Japon, practico la operacion valiente para dar el gran temor a los crueles reaccionarios japoneses y permitio en la zona de la capital el lanzamiento el cohete balistico haciendo quitar el rencor acumulado del pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Y juraron que si el CC del PTC da la orden cumpliran con la mision y deber sagrados de sus fidedignas fuerzas armadas nucleares poniendose en el frente del final combate sagrado por acabar con la confrontacion antiimperialista y antiyanqui."
