            "content": "U.S. ulterior intention revealed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- The \"missile threat\" from the DPRK touted by the United States is no more than a pretext for the establishment of its \"National Missile Defence\" system and gaining time for it, says Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today.\r\n It goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Clinton administration, the DPRK had multi-channelled dialogues with the United States, published a joint communique and assured the U.S. that it would declare moratorium on missile test fire during the time when the missile talks were under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has officially confirmed and proved the non-existence of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the new U.S. administration suspended the dialogue with the DPRK, which had been held during the previous administration. And it is intensifying the hostile policy toward the DPRK, while pulling it up over \"missile threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ruling circles' moves can never be justified in stepping up the development and establishment of the aggressive \"nmd\" on the pretext of the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves are chiefly aimed to form a strong missile network to increase their forestalling attack capacities, completely contain china and Russia by force of arms and establish their military domination over Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behaviour of the U.S. may spark a new acute arms race and a nuclear showdown.    \r\n\r\n"

President Kim Il Sung was, indeed, a great man of the world and the feats he performed in human history will shine forever. Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema said this on March 7 when he received credentials from the new DPRK ambassador e.p.\r\n He further said: Leader Kim Jong Il is now creditably carrying forward the revolutionary cause of Kim Il Sung. I believe that the Korean people will surely overcome any more serious trials than those in the period of \"arduous march\" as they are led by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Eyadema sincerely hoped that the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea would be achieved by federation formula at an early date under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. And he said that the Togolese people would strive to further develop the friendly and cooperative relations with the Korean people in the future, too.    \r\n\r\n"
