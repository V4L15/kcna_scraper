Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article,  and goes on:\r\n National independence is the main idea, spirit and core of the north-south declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent reunification of the nation will certainly be achieved when all the compatriots pool efforts and wisdom in the struggle, while strongly rejecting foreign forces' interference into the issue of the national reunification from the Juche-oriented viewpoint and stand that they are responsible for their own destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the way of peacefully reunifying the country in the interests of the north, the south and the whole nation under the actual conditions of Korea to work in the direction of achieving reunification by founding a unified federal state, keeping the ideologies and systems in the north and the south as they are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration indicates the way of solving the issue of the country's reunification most reasonably and fairly as it aims at achieving reunification by federal formula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration is one for the great unity of the nation and reunification that helps achieve the trust and harmony between the north and the south and national unity and reunification as soon as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is certain to come when the whole nation continues to vigorously advance along the road indicated by the declaration, the article stresses.    \r\n\r\n"

And they should immediately apologize for the repressive actions and unconditionally set free all the arrested Korean residents, says Minju Joson today in a commentary.\r\n The commentary further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are creating a terror-ridden anti-Chongryon atmosphere in Japan while ransacking Chongryon and walking away Koreans in Japan without legal ground. It is part of their intentional and premeditated campaign to undermine Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, this search by the Japanese reactionaries is a grave anti-DPRK smear campaign intended to defame the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never tolerate such frantic campaign. Its army and people hold dear the dignity and sovereignty of the country as their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their fixed will and stamina to punish mercilessly and without fail anyone who encroaches upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
