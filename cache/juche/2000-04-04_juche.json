            "content": "Finance Minister's report made at 3rd session of 10th SPA of DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The 3rd session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK opened here today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rim Kyong Suk, Minister of Finance, made a report on the first agenda item \"on the summing up of the fulfillment of the state budget for Juche 88 (1999) and on the state budget for Juche 89 (2000) in the DPRK.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She said in the report: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Worker's Party of Korea's revolutionary policy and positive steps have revitalized the national economy and put several industrial fields on the track of recovery. And there is a good prospect of raising the people's living standard in the near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Achievements were made in the fulfillment of last year's state budget. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year the total state budgetary revenue was 19,801,030,000 won, or 97.2 percent of the plan, and the total state budgetary expenditure was 20,018,210,000 won, or 98.2 percent of the plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year the state budgetary revenue failed to reach the planned level, but showed an increase over 1998. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its growth clearly proves that in the DPRK the economy has begun to recover and its independent financial foundation is being consolidated with each passing day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year the DPRK government increased appropriations for the national economy in the state budget. A huge investment was made in the construction of power stations, and in coal, iron and steel and machinery production and railway transport, the domains which play a key role in accelerating the building of an economically powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Investment in the building of power stations last year was 20 percent bigger than the previous year. The construction of large-scale hydro-power stations was pushed ahead, including an expansion project of the Thaechon Power Station and a second-stage construction of the Anbyon Youth Power Station. And a large number of minor power stations were built in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In coal industry a foundation was laid for rapid increase in coal output. The working people in the fields of metal and machine-building industries opened a good prospect of accelerating the Juche-orientation of metal industry and effecting a turn in iron and steel production, holding aloft the torch lit at the Songjin Steel Complex. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In railway transport a brisk drive was conducted to repair and consolidate coaches and wagons. The workers at the Kim Jong Thae Electric Locomotive Plant manufactured and repaired through their devoted efforts 100 electric locomotives, thus further increasing the transport capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The agricultural workers strove hard to do farming as required by the Juche farming method, bring about a radical change in seed selection and potato cultivation and carry out double-cropping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Taehongdan county integrated farm has been turned into a major base for a radical change in potato cultivation and a farm where comprehensive mechanization has been fully realized. And a modern chicken plant and a cattle farm were built to pave a wide way for developing stockbreeding onto a new stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   People in different parts of the country built many fish-breeding grounds by harnessing rivers, lakes, springs and hot springs and pisciculture was conducted on a large scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year's investment in science was 6.3 percent bigger than the previous year. Scientists and technicians successfully solved scientific and technological problems in microelectronic engineering and mechanical electronics, thus putting researches into up-to-date science and technology in these domains at a higher level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Signal successes were also made in various scientific researches, among them research into producing medicines of various kinds by gene engineering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year the DPRK government channelled huge funds into the land development and construction of monumental edifices for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The young builders completed the roadbed construction of the whole section of the 40-odd km Pyongyang-Nampho Motorway in a matter of one year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The soldier-builders, people and their helpers turned out in land leveling and rezoning project in North Phyongan Province following the completion of the similar project in Kangwon Province and finished the first stage project ahead of schedule and are pushing ahead with the second stage project at the last phase. The working people in South Hamgyong Province wrought such a miracle as building the modern Kwangmyongsong saltern on the seaside of Kumya bay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter said that such famous mountains and beauty spots as Mt. Kuwol, Mt. Chilbo and Ryongmun cavern were converted into more attractive scenic spots and pleasure grounds last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though hard pressed for everything, our people built magnificent monumental edifices and gave face-lifting to the land. This is a striking demonstration of their indomitable spirit, heroism and inexhaustible creative energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government allocated 14. 6 percent of the total state budgetary expenditure as military spending to increase the defence capability of the country last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Great efforts were exerted for the development of education, culture, public health and physical culture and sports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Educational institutions at all levels were equipped with modern facilities through the allocation of huge state funds thanks to the educational policy of the Worker's Party of Korea. And huge state funds were also spent for implementing the WPK's policy of preventive medicine in the field of public health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many successful literary and art works were created in the field of literature and art. And in the field of sports heroine jong song ok won the world women's marathon title, glorifying the country and delighting the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Despite difficult economic situation the Korean people lead an independent and creative life, receiving such huge benefits from the state as free education and health care without any taxes thanks to all the popular policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then the reporter referred to the state budget for the year 2000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She quoted General Secretary Kim Jong Il as saying: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"This year 2000 is a significant year, the glorious WPK's 55th anniversary, and a year of general advance to achieve a decisive turn in the building of a powerful nation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year we should firmly adhere to the WPK line of attaching great importance to ideology, the military and science and technology and channel big efforts into socialist economic construction for a leaping advance in building an economically powerful nation, the reporter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year the state budget has been worked out in such a way as to provide a satisfactory financial guarantee for the endeavors of the Korean people to successfully carry out the tasks for economic construction, defence building and socialist cultural construction, the tasks to be fulfilled in building a powerful nation, and glorify the 55th anniversary of the WPK as a grand festival of proud victors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The total state budgetary revenue and expenditure for this year is 20,405,320,000 won respectively, up 3.1 percent in total revenue and up 1.9 percent in total expenditure over last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The government of the republic will increase the expenditure for the national economy this year. Primary efforts will go to the power and coal industries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   State investment in the power and coal industries is expected to grow 15.4 percent and 12.3 percent over last year respectively to consolidate the foundation for production in these domains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year innovations will be effected in the production of electricity and coal, a productive boost at the major industrial establishments in such key industrial sectors as metal and chemical industries and railway transport improved to lay more solid foundations to build an economically powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year's state investment in agricultural and light industrial sectors is expected to go up 5 percent and 4 percent respectively over last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Allocation of funds for the development of science and technology this year will be 5.4 percent bigger than last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year we will complete the Pyongyang-Nampho Motorway before the 55th anniversary of the WPK, completely finish the land leveling and rezoning project in North Phyongan Province and dynamically push ahead with a similar project in South Hwanghae Province and the Kaechon-lake Thaesong waterway project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The government of the republic envisages an allocation of 14.5 percent of its total state budgetary expenditure as military spending, pursuant to the party's line of attaching great importance to the military. Huge funds will be channelled into socialist cultural construction, including education, culture, public health and physical culture and sports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year, too, the government of the republic will send a large amount of educational aid fund and stipends for the children of Korean nationals in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state budget for this year is a revolutionary and popular budget aimed to properly tap and use the country's financial resources to speed up a general advance for building a powerful socialist nation and exert big efforts to improving the people's standard of living. \r\n\r\n"

This is another significance of the work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President in the work said that the main way of putting the production on a normal footing under the new circumstance is to give definite priority to the production of goods of first- and second-stage processing and indicated one by one the ways of effective planning in the domain of production and organize and guide the production under a meticulous plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the independent national economy of the DPRK has paid off profusely despite the imperialists' intensified moves for isolating and stifling it. It is a springboard from which the Korean people can reach a higher stage of building an economically powerful country. \r\n\r\n"

This is attributable to Japan's refusal to liquidate its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK-Japan talks should focus on the debate about the issue of liquidating Japan's past and be oriented to its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Everything depends on with what will and stand the Japanese side approaches the talks with the DPRK. The DPRK is of the view that it is important for Japan to approach the talks with a sincere stand and will to put the bilateral relations on the orbit of normalization in such a way as to solve the issue of liquidating its past at an early date and then settle other matters on the basis of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK-Japan talks are not for the sake of one side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, both sides should not hold the talks, reading other's face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The talks are for the sake of both sides. They are needed to meet the aspiration and requirement of the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The lesson taught by the past DPRK-Japan talks shows that the talks will be useless and produce only undesirable results if they fail to make any progress due to a verbal spat. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean warmonger's reckless remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Jo Song Thae, \"Minister of National Defense\" of South Korea, at a \"monthly meeting\" with bosses of the \"Ministry of National Defense\" and the \"joint chiefs of staff headquarters\" and at a recent \"commemoration of the 32nd anniversary of the homeland reserve forces\" cried out for \"keeping themselves combat ready to cope with threat and provocation from the north.\"   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK put forward the army-first idea without hesitation and has paid  due attention to increasing its defense capability because of the U.S. And the South Korean warmongers' massive reinforcement of forces and their adventurous war exercises to bring the situation to the brink of war in a bid to invade the north according to the scenario for the second Korean war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters' talk about the non-existent \"threat\" and \"provocation\" by someone is nothing but sophism to justify their preparations to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is also a cunning trick to arrest the people's anti-\"government\" struggle now gaining momentum in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters in the grip of a serious ruling crisis are busy spreading the rumor of \"threat from the north\" in a bid to fan up confrontation with the north among South Korean people and divert elsewhere their bitter hatred against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, they are seriously mistaken if they think they can mislead public opinion and achieve their foul aims with such a poor trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers should stop all their vicious moves to deceive and flout people and hide their preparations for a war of aggression against the north. \r\n\r\n"

It has massively deployed nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, sophisticated offensive weapons and equipment in and around South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its aerial espionage against the DPRK is being escalated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese developments reminiscent of those on the eve of war clearly prove that the U.S. warmongers' moves to provoke a war against the DPRK have entered a very dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people and the people's army are fully prepared for any confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to properly judge its opponent and behave itself.\r\n\r\n"

This is the result of self-reliance under the banner of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reality of the DPRK clearly proves that the President's idea of independence is very just and absolutely right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The people of Sri Lanka is the master of Sri Lanka and they know well the reality of Sri Lanka. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They called upon the people to strive hard for the prosperity of the country, bearing deep in mind that the road of self-reliance is the right way of carving out the destiny of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A letter to the great leader Kim Jong Il was adopted at the symposium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The letter said the Juche idea founded by the President is the beacon of hope and the banner of struggle indicating that self-reliance for those people who are building a new society is the right way of carving out the destiny of the country and the nation and achieving prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letter expressed the belief that the brave Korean people under the wise guidance of General Secretary Kim Jong Il will achieve greater success in the building of a powerful socialist country, firmly maintaining the line of attaching importance to ideology, the military and science and technology under the uplifted banner of the Juche idea and self-reliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
