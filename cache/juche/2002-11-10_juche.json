Korean students' sit-in strike to protect monument \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 10 (KCNA) -- Students of Seoul National University reportedly went on a sit-in strike to protest the university authorities' demand for the removal of the monument to the June 15 joint declaration and protect it.\r\n The monument was erected by at least 5,600 students and professors of the university on august 14 to mark the anniversary of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The university authorities have repeatedly demanded the removal of the monument since its erection. At dawn of Oct. 19 they suddenly began to remove it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Enraged at this, the strikers stopped the vandalism. After pitching tents around the monument they went on a sit-in strike in demand of its restoration and an apology from the university president.    \r\n   \r\n"
