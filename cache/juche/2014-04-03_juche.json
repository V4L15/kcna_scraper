Such moves are nothing but an attempt to prevent the DPRK from growing stronger in face of all sorts of challenges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the DPRK, as a full-fledged nuclear state, has a favorable condition to concentrate all efforts on economic construction and improvement of people's living in reliance upon the powerful war deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces are seeking to suffocate the DPRK by inveigling it into arms race, but the DPRK is channeling big efforts into economic construction and improvement of the people's living while steadily beefing up war deterrent without increasing defense expenditures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bolstering self-defensive nuclear deterrent precisely means economic construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sustained development of nuclear and space rocket technologies is instrumental to upgrading the nation's science to the world's level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Development of the Juche-oriented atomic power industry also makes it possible to settle the nation's electricity shortage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Indeed, the line has turned the DPRK's geopolitical position into one decisive of the world's political structure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK can greatly benefit from nuclear test and it will drastically cut down investment into manufacturing conventional weapons but channel more fund into developing the economy. This is the view of the entire Korean nation and the world's progressives on the WPK's line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK's new line is scientific and truthful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK people will steadfastly maintain the line they have chosen in face of all sorts of challenges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time and justice stand on the side of the DPRK and final victory is in store for it."

Its \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK for no reason is going beyond the tolerance limit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. made no scruple of slandering even the results of the recent election of deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly in the DPRK though it was held with success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should totally roll back its anachronistic hostile policy to the DPRK with the right viewpoint and stand on its nuclear deterrence and stop at once the groundless \"human rights\" racket against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are convinced that the Korean people would frustrate the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, confidently advance along the road of independence chosen by themselves and thus achieve the final victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We fully support the statement of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK."
