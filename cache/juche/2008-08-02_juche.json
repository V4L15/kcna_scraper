This can be explained by the fact that the creating staff succeeded in finding out Korean style modality by use of diverse means and methods of representation. To be more specific, the creators found out the core of the famous song and oriented all its aspects to explaining its seed. They were successful in the musical plot and organization of its composition. They also succeeded in finding out the tune deep in national coloring by preserving the original tune as the main tune in the music arrangement and combining national musical instruments with Western ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stressed that the above-mentioned orchestra and chorus has been produced as a masterpiece that can represent the era of Songun, the new century, entirely thanks to the energetic leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They underscored the need for all creators and artistes to produce more masterpieces in the Songun era by thoroughly arming themselves with the WPK's literary and art ideas and theories and earnestly learning from the success and experience gained in the creation of the above-said orchestra and chorus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attending the seminar were Minister of Culture Kang Nung Su, Kim Pyong Hun, chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of the Unions of Literature and the Arts of Korea, and creators, artistes, teachers and students in the field of culture and arts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is derived from Usanguk which exercised jurisdiction over Ullung and Usan (Tok) islets in the early 6th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLater \"Usan\" was changed into \"Tok\" of today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"Geographical Handbook of True Records of King Sejong\" (1432) made clear the relations between Ullung and Usan islets and Usanguk, saying: \"Usan and Murung islets are located in the middle of the sea east of the prefecture. The two islets being not far away from each other, one can see the other islet from one islet in a clear day. They were called Usanguk in the period of Silla dynasty\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTok Islet was once called \"Sambong Islet\" or \"Kaji Islet\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"True Records of King Songjong\" says: \"Three rocks lie in a row to the north of the islet. Lying next is Jung Islet and there is a small islet to the west of it. All of them are washed by the same sea water\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTok Islet was called Sambong mainly by the people of Hamgyong Province in those days for its external features. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKaji Islet, its another name, came from kaji which meant the seal in inherent Korean, which is the special product of Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA record about Kaji Islet is found in \"True Records of King Jongjo\" (June Jongjo 18). According to it, Han Chang Guk, a military commander of Wolsong, went to Ullung and there he changed his course to Kaji Islet, where he caught two Kaji (seals) in April 1794. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSok and Tok were attached to the islet after the 1880s when active development of Ullung Islet was undertaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTok Islet has also European names.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Much upset by this, the minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade instructed the assistant minister active in Singapore to get the above-said part deleted from the statement unconditionally. Acting upon the instruction, south Korean puppets met those concerned of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore, the chair state of the meeting, and repeatedly implored them to delete that part from the statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This mean behavior of the Lee group comes under fire by a signed commentary of Minju Joson Friday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group unhesitatingly stripped bare on the international arena the treacherous aim sought by them in pursuing inter-Korean confrontation, while negating and opposing the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing the former, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This undisguised act of treachery explains the reason why Lee said in his recent \"policy speech\" made at the \"National Assembly\" that the October 4 declaration might be discussed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By origin, Lee, displeased with the above-said declarations, regarded them as bete noire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRight after the declarations were published, Lee sidestepped and negated the above-said declarations in a bid to stem the trend of the times towards national reconciliation and unity and reunification of the country and do harm to fellow countrymen, backed by the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent demeanor of the Lee group substantially proved that what he uttered was nothing but a sheer lie intended to allure the people desirous of national reconciliation, unity and the reunification of the country and mislead the public opinion in a bid to tide over the ever-deepening ruling crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As shown by the present reality, Lee Myung Bak is no more than a philistine who is accustomed to telling lies and a political charlatan with whom one can hardly deal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as such philistine and swindler as Lee stays in power in south Korea, there will be only hurdles in the way of national reconciliation, unity and reunification, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
