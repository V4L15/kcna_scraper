At this confab, they assessed what they called \"the level of threat\" of the DPRK's \"WMD\" including nuclear weapons and examined measures and alternatives for sharing information and making effective use of them. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a by-lined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The committee was aimed to specify the preparations for a new Korean war and secure a pretext for provoking a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"level of threat\" touted by them clearly shows how desperately they are trying to brand the DPRK as a \"criminal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a height of effrontery for the U.S. warmongers to make profound confusion of right and wrong and find fault with the DPRK under the pretext of its non-existent \"threat\".
