            "content": "Japan urged to redress its past \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- Japan has entered the 21st century after evading through all sorts of gimmicks the settlement of what it committed, bringing unspeakable misfortune and sufferings to humankind. In this connection rodong sinmun today in a signed commentary says that the Korean people will certainly make Japan apologize and compensate for its crimes in the new century.\r\n The Japanese authorities have not yet apologized nor compensated for their past crimes against the Korean people although more than half a century has passed since the Japanese imperialists' defeat, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have so far made a mockery of the Korean people talking about \"regret\" and \"repentance\" and even went so far as to assert that they can not redeem their past wrongs after fabricating even the non-existent issue of \"kidnapping.\"  This shows what extent the impudence and moral baseness of the japanese authorities have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have refused to make reparation and compensation though Germany and other former war criminal states had already done. This is evidence showing the impudence and moral baseness peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By refusing to admit and apologize for its history of aggression and crimes and sidestepping the issue of making compensation for them Japan seeks to realise in the 21st century its ambition for reinvasion, which it had failed to realise in the 20th century, and keep its crime-woven past buried in oblivion or make it fade away from people's memory forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The only way for Japan to win international confidence and live in peace is to redeem its past, the commentary notes, and stresses that the Korean people will never allow Japan to go without redressing its past.    \r\n\r\n"
