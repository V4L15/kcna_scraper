            "content": "Inter-Korean General-Level Military Talks Open  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- The 6th north-south general-level military talks opened in the portion of the south side in Panmunjom Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks both sides continued the discussion on the main agenda item of the talks \"On military measures to prevent clashes in the waters of the West Sea of Korea and realize joint fishing there.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lieut. General of the Korean People's Army Kim Yong Chol, head of the north side's delegation, made a contrastive analysis of the differing stances and attitudes of both sides that have so far been manifested in the discussion and accused the south side of its wrong approach towards the issue of the peace of the country and military detente. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side is persistently evading the fundamental solution to the issue of preventing clashes in the waters of the West Sea of Korea, talking about the \"settlement of peace\" and \"building of a peace-keeping mechanism.\" It is also keen to misuse the issue of joint fishing for meeting its political and strategic purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side does not show any earnest efforts for the settlement of the issues related to the West Sea including the prevention of clashes. This goes to prove that it does not have any stand of thinking of the destiny of the country and nation before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side is categorically rejecting the principled proposals for preventing clashes in the waters of the West Sea and realizing joint fishing there, not away from the hackneyed Cold War-minded way of thinking. It does not hesitate to shamelessly assert that the \"northern limit line\" is the only marine boundary line in the West Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even at this time when the talks between the north and south militaries are underway the south side is resorting to such mean psychological warfare against the north as scattering handbills in violation of the north-south agreement while escalating its intrusion into the territorial waters of the north side, asserting that they are the waters under its control. This furnishes a clear testimony that the south side is keen on the confrontation of ideology and ism and military showdown, swimming against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he proposed a series of ways of advancing the talks in conformity with the expectation and wishes of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military authorities of both sides should have firm will and determination to be a main player in preventing clashes in the waters of the West Sea and realizing joint fishing without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the south side should be bold enough to drop its wrong assertions and views based on the Cold War-minded way of thinking.  The south side should not interpret and distort as it pleases the inter-Korean agreements already adopted thanks to the concerted efforts of the nation and the provisions of the internationally recognized law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to refrain from any acts to vitiate the atmosphere of the talks in order to advance the talks between the north and south militaries, the head of the north side's delegation demanded the south side halt various forms of psychological warfare against the dialogue partner, the reckless intrusion into the other's territorial waters and all the war maneuvers being staged together with foreign forces as an immediate task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And on July 24, 1907, they forged and proclaimed the illegal \"Korea-Japan Convention\" (\"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty\") without the permission, signature and royal seal of the king, robbing the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty of all its rights to administer internal affairs, which had remained in name only, including the legislative, juridical and administrative rights, root and all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Three days later, on July 27, they promulgated as \"Law\" No. 2 the \"Security Law\" which stipulated the harsh suppression anytime of all actions including assembly, association and demonstration of the Korean people as well as patriotic people and organizations not to their liking under the pretext of \"maintenance of safety and order\", thus legalizing their fascist suppression and obliteration of the anti-Japanese sentiments and struggle of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still today, the 21st century, the Japanese reactionaries are avoiding admission, apology and compensation for their past bloody crimes. On the contrary, they are distorting and justifying them and working overtime to revive militarism and stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These days the Japanese reactionaries, persistently clinging to the hostile maneuvers against the DPRK, are escalating their crackdown upon on the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) to destroy it. And they openly marked Tok Islet as one belonging to Japan in the \"white paper on national defense for 2007\". These facts clearly indicate that the anti-DPRK confrontation moves of the descendants of Japanese militarism and their reinvasion scheme have reached an intolerable stage.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the \"treaty\" lacked all those elements like the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists declared to the world that the \"treaty\" was concluded after being sealed only by Ri Wan Yong, head of the pro-Japanese puppet Cabinet, under such spurious signboards as \"promotion of prosperity\" and \"guarantee of happiness.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They used this false treaty as a \"legal ground\" for enforcing a harsh colonial rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries have still refused to admit, apologize and compensate for their crime-woven past. To make the matters worse, they are distorting and justifying it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will certainly force the Japanese imperialists to pay for the crimes committed by them in the past and resolutely frustrate their moves against the DPRK and their moves to stage a comeback to Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

If they are joined by carrier Enterprise task force, it will mean that this region will be higher than any other regions of the world in the density of the deployment of the striking forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, there is a rumor that the U.S. will deploy carrier Truman in the region in the days ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now trumpeting that its measure to bolster its military muscle in the Persian Gulf region is aimed to \"contribute to the stability of the Middle East.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has always used a preemptive military attack by huge armed forces as a basic method for carrying out its strategy for world domination. It has always used military strength against the anti-imperialist countries and strongholds of strategic importance, thereby attaining its military strategic purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By amassing carrier task forces in the Persian Gulf region this time the U.S. seeks to meet its political, military and economic interests there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for disturbing global peace and security.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

She, addressing a press conference with Japanese mediapersons, expressed the will to revise the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" in a bid to extend by one year the presence of the \"Maritime Self-Defence Forces (MSDF)\" in the Indian Ocean active to refuel warships of the U.S. and other forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes in this regard in a by-lined commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her intention to keep warships of the MSDF involved in the U.S. forces' \"operations against terrorism\" betrays her militarist tendency and disposition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She was a main player in working out Japan's security strategy. After being appointed adviser to the prime minister on national security of the Abe regime formed in September last year, she played a big role in mapping out the security strategy as intended by her master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She is known to have close relationship with Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This relationship grew stronger between the two big wigs when the former was minister of Environment and concurrently minister in charge of Okinawa and Northern issues and the latter was Chief Cabinet Secretary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She is a political careerist as greedy as Abe and a right-wing conservative figure keen on militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In other word, she is a militarist philistine steeped in bitterness toward Korea and the ambition to reinvade it to the marrow of her bone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is bound to go to ruin as those blinded with militarism are enforcing right-wing conservative politics, holding important posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was possible because they had firm political and military foundations laid by Kim Il Sung under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung was a rare statesman versed in military affairs and invincible and iron-willed commander who laid down the principle of the revolution advancing with the might of arms and paved the unique way of the Songun revolution. In the first days of pioneering the Korean revolution, the President put forward the unique idea of attaching importance to the arms and to military affairs and put forth enormous efforts to reinforcing the driving force of the revolution with the armed units as a core. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He firmly adhered to the principle of Songun in building a new country after the liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory in the Fatherland Liberation War demonstrated the matchless might of the Korean People's Army which had grown in strength and developed in the storm of the Songun revolution under the leadership of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, less than two years after the proclamation of its foundation, could decisively drive back the large-scale military invasion of the U.S. imperialists. It owed this to the invincible revolutionary army fostered by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory in the war was a brilliant victory of the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu created in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle under the leadership of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was also a brilliant victory of the great army-people unity which traces its origin to the anti-Japanese revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Fatherland Liberation War of the people of the DPRK who firmly defended the destiny of the country and the nation and worked military miracles which would shine long in the history of the anti-imperialist struggle with the might of Songun left behind really a valuable philosophical principle of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If victory is to be won in a showdown with imperialism, it is necessary, first, second and third, to have great strategist and a brilliant commander of Songun as supreme commander. This is the most precious truth drawn from the Fatherland Liberation War.\r\n The gifted military wisdom and iron-willed faith, unshakable grit and astounding pluck of the President were the source of the unyielding fight waged by the DPRK army and people with conviction of victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Standing at the head of the Songun revolution today is Kim Jong Il, son of the guerillas of Mt. Paektu and great brilliant commander of Songun. No force on earth can match the DPRK army and people who are led by the peerlessly brilliant commander of Songun and are possessed of an invincible revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu and unbreakable single-minded unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Todo esto demuestra fehacientemente que llegaron a la etapa insoportable las maniobras de esos descendientes de los militaristas japoneses, que buscan la confrontacion con la RPDC y persiguen nueva agresion a esta.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
