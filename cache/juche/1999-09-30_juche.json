But this expectation was upset when People's Artiste Hong Jong Hwa gave a recent solo dance on her 60th birthday at the April 25 House of Culture, gratifying the audience with her full range of refined prowess. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The famous dancer, seemingly in her forties, dominated the stage with elastic grace in \"ecstasy\", \"drum dance\" and \"gang dance,\" reeling out complex subtleties surprising even for young dancers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She was born second daughter of a railway worker. At the age of 17, she finished the state dance school and made her debut in national dance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Endowed with unusually quick reflexes, she was a dancer of surpassing zeal and energy. She trained so hard that her feet often bled and her toe-nails were pinched out. Finally she became expert at superb movement, quite a challenge to her colleagues. At 20, she established her reputation at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her dance works continued to improve on national and modern lines and became representative of Korean national dance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She is credited with a total of 160 pieces of dance which have been a favorite at home and in some 50 countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Il Sung met her a dozen times and highly praised her accomplishments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  She is now working as a senior choreographer at the song and dance ensemble of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On August 19 this year, leader Kim Jong Il honored her with a 60th-birthday dinner. She was moved to tears and vowed to devote the rest of her life to national dance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"In my country of Kim Il Sung's nation\", she said, \"sixty is the prime of life and ninety is the first step to old age.

But he could not get a job as he was an intellectual of the colonial nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After liberation in August, 1945 he wished to develop sericulture of Korea, but that could not be realized in South Korea under the occupation of the U.S. troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His hope came true only under the care of the President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In October, Juche 35 (1946) the President met him upon coming over to the north and indicated a detailed orientation of developing sericulture in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He succeeded in cultivating  various species of silkworms and tussah silkworms. He was the first in the world to raise species of castor silkworms which can stand winter in the temperate zone by hybridizing pure species of castor silkworm with wild phirosamic cyntia pryer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He wrote books \"On Tussah Silkworm\", \"On Castor Silkworm\" and \"Kye Ung Sang Selected Works\" (vols. 1-3) which systematize technology for the production of tussah silkworm and castor silkworm for the first time in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And he was an author of many treatises and scientific and technical books that academically systematize achievements in scientific researches and experience in production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He received professorship and certificate of doctor no.1 in Juche 37 (1948) and became the first academician of the Academy of Sciences in Korea in April Juche 41 (1952). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was a deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK in his lifetime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government awarded the Title of Labour Hero and the people's prize to him in 1963 in recognition of his distinguished service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is a university named after him in Sariwon city of North Hwanghae Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He lies in state in the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery in Pyongyang. \r\n\r\n"

But this will mean rewriting just a few unessential provisions of the \"law,\" leaving main framework untouched. After all, it will remain unchanged in its nature as the fascist law, they held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They stressed that all the political parties, organizations and personages from all walks of life at home and abroad who truly hope for democracy and reunification, should unite in solidarity with each other and launch a powerful joint struggle for the abrogation of the \"security law.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An appeal to political parties and organizations in South Korea was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Describing the \"security law\" as a legal mechanism for confrontation and division and a noose of fascism, which are incompatible with national unity and reunification, the appeal demanded a complete and total repeal of this \"law.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the South Korean authorities are refusing to meet this demand while deleting just a few provisions or rewriting terminology. This means that they will continue their bloody repression of the people by this \"law,\" the bayonet of fascism, it said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It called upon the political parties and organizations and personages from all walks of life in South Korea to determinedly turn out in the joint struggle to totally root out the \"security law.\" \r\n\r\n"
