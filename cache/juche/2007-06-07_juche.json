El 6 de junio del 35 (1946) de la Era Juche, fundo la UNC, que hereda la tradicion del Cuerpo Infantil Antijapones, dando inicio a la nueva historia de formacion de los infantes como fidedignos continuadores de la revolucion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente Kim Jong Il, quien tiene la misma concepcion de las generaciones futuras del Presidente, desde el comienzo de su direccion sobre la revolucion y construccion, realizo ingentes esfuerzos por formarlas en fidedignos sucesores de la revolucion jucheana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bajo la consigna de \"!Preparemonos siempre para la patria socialista!\", todos los afiliados de la UNC deben prepararse como fuertes pilares de la gran potencia prospera.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Cultura de Rakrang demuestra superioridad de nacion coreana\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 6 de junio (ATCC) -- La cultura de Rakrang fue creada en el reino homonimo, que existio entre el siglo I a.n.e. y el siglo III n.e. en la region central y noroeste de Corea, y en el de Taebang derivado del primero y otros estados pequenos que habian sido fundados por los descendientes de Kojoson (desde principios del siglo 30 a.n.e. hasta 108 a.n.e.). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los moradores de Rakrang y los descendientes de Kojoson desarrollaron la ya excelente cultura creada en el periodo de este segundo Estado esclavista. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las reliquias y vestigios descubiertos a granel en una zona en torno al municipio de Rakrang de la ciudad de Pyongyang demuestran el alto nivel de la cultura de Rakrang en la arquitectura, la elaboracion de metales, la sericultura, la textura, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo mas destacado en ella es que fueron creadas las estructuras arquitectonicas mas racionales y plasticas aplicando las tecnicas logradas en el periodo de Kojoson en la construccion de palacio real, viviendas y tumbas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las tablas grandes y delicadas, ladrillos con estampas tan finas que se asemejan a los productos artesanales, los tejados en forma oval y las vias, que fueron hallados en las tumbas con ataud de madera y las de ladrillo y tronco descubiertas en la misma zona, permiten conocer claramente de la extraordinaria arquitectura de los moradores de Rakrang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tambien fueron desenterrados armas metalicas de gran eficiencia, arreos y otros articulos de herreria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Entre ellos, la espada de hierro desmontable de 110 centimetros de largo y otras armas de acero fundido fueron hechas con la metalurgia bajo alta temperatura. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@De otro lado, dan constancia de la orfebreria delicada y superfina de aquellos moradores las elegantes hebillas de oro y plata. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@En particular, es imposible ver en otros paises la hebilla de oro en que estan incrustados junto con mas de 40 jades un dragon y sus 7 criaturas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Ademas, en aquel periodo se desarrollo la textura de seda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@La cultura de Rakrang arraigada en la historia y tradiciones culturales de Kojoson es un valioso patrimonio de la nacion coreana.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
