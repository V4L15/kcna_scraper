            "content": "Mass foundation for party building \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- The mass foundation for building the Worker's Party of Korea was laid and consolidated during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle (1925-1945). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Korean communists worked hard to awaken the masses to consciousness and unite them in organizations in the rigorous period of the armed struggle, the main trend of revolution at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung dispatched a number of political underground workers to all parts of the country during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle so that they might conduct political work among the masses to lay mass foundation for founding the party. They formed mass organizations across the country to rally the masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The work of building the mass ground for party foundation was carried out in close relation to the anti-Japanese national united front movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President founded the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland on May 5, 1936, involving people from all walks of life who were against Japanese imperialism. This was a historic event in strengthening the mass ground for the party foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The network of the association rapidly spread out to areas around the Amnok and Tuman rivers, different parts of Korea and even to residential quarters of Koreans in Manchuria and Japan. Organizations under the association which were formed under various names according to local specific conditions involved at least 200,000 people of different social standings -- workers, farmers, students, urban petty-bourgeoisie, nationalists and patriotic religionists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President dispatched excellent party members to leading posts of sub-organizations at all levels and enlisted commanding officers and members of the main forces of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army into those sub-organizations. Therefore, the association played an important role in consolidating the mass ground of the party as well as organizing the masses of broad sections in the anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This mass ground laid during the anti-Japanese struggle was one of important factors of founding the WPK in a less than two months after the liberation of the country (August 1945). \r\n\r\n"

But it is nothing but a trite double-dealing trick to cover up its aggressive nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is apt to talk about \"peace\" whenever it sits face to face with the DPRK but, no sooner had it left the conference room than it hatched a plot to hurt the latter and accelerated its moves to put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The massive arms buildup disclosed by Shelton recently was a premeditated and intentional action to make the second Korean war a fait accompli and put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is foolish of the U.S. to try to justify its aggressive maneuvers under the absurd pretext of the non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the enemy recklessly unleash a war of aggression, they will not escape from merciless and deadly blows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to listen to our warning and immediately halt its reckless arms buildup. \r\n\r\n"
