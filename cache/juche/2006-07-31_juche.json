He personally worked out the law and promulgated it on July 30, Juche 35 (1946), she added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The promulgation of the law by Kim Il Sung marked a great event to be specially recorded in the history of the women's movement of humankind as it put an end to the Korean women's status of dependence that lasted for thousands of years and brought about a radical change in their position and life, she said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The law is the most revolutionary and Juche-based programme for women's emancipation as it comprehensively indicated the ways for the successful solution of the women's problem and a great code of love for the women the kind of which can hardly be found in any other parts of the world as the noble will for respect for women is fully reflected in its every clause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President let the women who became full-fledged players of the society thanks to the law take an active part in the first democratic election and such mass movements as the campaign against illiteracy and the general ideological mobilization movement for building the country. And during the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War he wisely led them to display a high degree of patriotic devotion on the front and in the rear and contribute to the victory in the war. This helped them demonstrate to the whole world their resourcefulness and stamina as powerful independent human beings under the leadership of the Party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@The noble exploits performed by Kim Il Sung in solving the women's problem have been carried forward at a higher stage under the outstanding and tested leadership of Kim Jong Il and the Korean women's movement with a long history and shining tradition has achieved biggest success in its development in the Songun era when a great prosperous powerful nation is dawning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The reporter appealed to the Korean women to fully display their wisdom and heroic spirit in the on-going general march of Songun revolution to bring prosperity to the country with the great honor of living and making revolution in the era of Songun, a new era of Juche, holding Kim Jong Il, an illustrious commander of Mt.Paektu, in high esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the women should hold the President in high esteem as an eternal leader of the Workers' Party and people of Korea and the sun of Juche and resolutely defend and glorify the undying feats performed by him for the cause of the women's emancipation, she noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should learn from the example set by Kim Jong Suk, woman general of Mt. Paektu, in devotedly defending the leader and thus become steadfast women revolutionaries who devotedly follow Kim Jong Il in thinking and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should carry forward the brilliant tradition of unity which was established in the early period of the Korean revolution and has been consolidated since then, and consolidate as firm as a rock the single-minded unity of our revolutionary ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Korean women will wage a more vigorous struggle to achieve national reunification in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration and boost the friendship and solidarity with the world progressive women, holding high the banner of independence against imperialism, the banner of socialism, and work hard to build a new world, independent, peaceful and friendly, she concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But they dare not fire guns at the DPRK which they have designated as \"an axis of evil\" and a \"target of preemptive nuclear attack.\" It is because we have powerful deterrent for self-defence, the invincible arms enough to wipe out any aggression forces at one stroke.

This is another act of treachery little short of selling off the interests of the nation, yielding to the brigandish demand of the U.S.\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in a statement Saturday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities set a precedent of taking over the devastated land that has been used as U.S. military bases, thus forcing south Korea to bear even the cost for the depollution of scores of U.S. military bases to be handed over in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compelled the south Koreans to suffer the national disgrace of even covering the huge cost for the rehabilitation of polluted environment, far from receiving due compensation from the criminals who devastated their land, lording it over for more than 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the foolish behavior of south Korea. It unreasonably took issue with the north that has defended south Korea with Songun and suspended even humanitarian aid, yielding to the pressure of its American master. Moreover, it decided to spend a colossal amount of money collected as taxes from people for depollution, not uttering even a word of protest against the U.S. that has reduced half of its territory into a wasteland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a shame on the nation that the south Koreans are still undergoing tragic sufferings under the U.S. military occupation and colonial domination even in the new century, the statement said, calling on the south Koreans from all walks of life to turn out in a vigorous struggle to frustrate the sycophantic authorities' treacherous moves, have all the U.S. military bases in south Korea dismantled and drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The recent match left the most undesirable blot ever known in the history of the Asian women's football matches,it said,adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe match aroused such great disappointment and concern among sportspersons and people of Asia and the rest of the world entirely because the Italian referee and an Australian lineswoman committed deliberate and shameless partial refereeing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the note, Chinese players twice made hand-touches in the penalty area during the match but the referee deliberately refrained from declaring an 11-meter penalty kick though these fouls were made in the areas quite discernable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was an intentional deed to downplay the points gained by the DPRK team as much as possible, a clumsy behavior to rattle the nerves of its team. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The note continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Australian lineswoman was so unreasonable and shameless as to partially referee the match with bitter feelings towards the DPRK team. This was clearly proved by the fact that when the team scored a goal two minutes before the end of the match, she unfairly insisted that it was offside though it was a goal, thus declaring the clear goal null and void. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts prove that the Italian referee and the Australian lineswoman, prompted by a vicious aim to make the Korean team fail at any cost, resorted to premeditated and deliberate partial refereeing, spoiling the noble sports spirit and obstructing the development of Asian women's football. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The note said that it was, indeed, regrettable that DPRK footballers were compelled to lodge a protest with the referee and the lineswoman out of the intolerable anger at the unfair and wanton refereeing and shameless declaration by them in the whole course of the match but what really matters is what lashed them into such fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the referee and the lineswoman not committed such unreasonable and dastardly acts that made the sportspersons of the world blush, such thing would not have happened, it said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lodging a strong protest as regards the above-said happenings, Kim Jong Su on behalf of the DPRK Football Association strongly demanded the following measures: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firstly, the Asian Football Confederation and the Organizing Committee of the Championships should ensure that matches be refereed impartially and strictly punish the Italian referee and the Australian lineswoman for their unfair refereeing of the recent match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, the Referees Committee of the Championships should take a step to let the DPRK team and the Chinese team hold another match so that they may fairly contest for victory now that the committee admitted the Australian lineswoman was wrong to declare the goal scored by the DPRK team two minutes before the end of the match as an offside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, the Organizing Committee of the Championships should withdraw at once the unreasonable measure for disqualifying DPRK footballers for the mere reason that they protested against the undisguised wrong refereeing of the Australian lineswoman.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
