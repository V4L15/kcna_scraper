            "content": "Inter-Korean fishery working contact proposed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Fisheries of the DPRK in a statement today once again proposed to the south side an urgent contact between fishery working officials of the north and the south which they had already agreed to have in Mt. Kumgang area. And he hoped that the south side would positively respond to this offer in the cooperative spirit.\r\n He noted:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side said at the fourth round of the inter-Korean ministerial talks held in Pyongyang at the end of last year that it would offer part of its fishing ground in the East Sea of Korea to the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"2001 meeting for the independent reunification of the Korean nation\" held here on Jan. 10 expressed the expectation that this sincere offer would be accepted as soon as possible for the benefit of the fishermen in the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was prompted by the genuine compatriotic and brotherly stand that there should be no distinction between the north and the south as far as the work for the prosperity of the nation is concerned and one should not seek only economic interests if he is to serve the fellow countrymen, the spokesman said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of cooperation between the two sides in fisheries was raised by the north side in the early 1970s. in the subsequent period we made positive efforts to this end on several occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic Pyongyang summit was held between the north and the south and the June 15 north-south joint declaration was adopted to ensure the balanced development of the national economy and promote cooperation and exchange in economic field. As a result, economic cooperation is now high on the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation we are of the view that cooperation between the north and the south in fisheries should be realized without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such cooperation will greatly help rationally use marine resources, precious wealth of the Korean nation, for the prosperity of the nation, and substantially improve the standard of the south Korean fishermen's living.    \r\n\r\n"
