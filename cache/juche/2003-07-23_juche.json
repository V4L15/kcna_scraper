If the U.S. once again invades the DPRK where the army and all the people replete with the anti-U.S. spirit are single-heartedly united around Kim Jong Il, it will be thrown into an irretrievable abyss of history.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu, at the cost of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people are in unshakable ideological readiness and preparedness to counter a fiercer and tougher fight than in the past fatherland liberation war. Our revolutionary ranks are the purest crystal body of idea and confidence which leaves no room for cowards and wavers and are a crack unit of human bullets and bombs. With no pressure, blockade, appeasement and psychological operations can the imperialists make a breakthrough in our revolutionary ranks of death-defying defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people will defend the socialist motherland of Juche at the cost of their lives and highly display the dignity of the DPRK under the banner of Songun of  Kim Jong Il.     \r\n    \r\n"

This does not pose any threat as it proceeds from the consistent policy of the DPRK government which defines independence and peace as the avowed idea of its foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the relations between the DPRK and Japan in military aspect are concerned, it is the DPRK, not Japan, which is exposed to a threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's unilateral hostile policy toward the DPRK is all the more dangerous because it is intended to realize \"the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\" Its moves to introduce an interceptor missile system and its plan to build a carrier-type escort ship are, in essence, military preparations to revive the colonial system in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that Japan is not interested in a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue but seeks to render the situation complicated and use it as a justification for modernizing the \"self-defense forces\" and for becoming a military power.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. indicted for abusing UN Charter\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 22 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Lawyers Committee issued a detailed report today to indict to the world the U.S. forces present in South Korea for their criminal acts in abusing the names of the \"UN Forces\" and the \"UN Command.\"\r\n The U.S., it says, set the stage for a \"commemorative event\" in the name of the \"un command\" in South Korea on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement (AA). This is one more ruse intended to tamper with the history in which they inflicted all sorts of misfortunes and pains upon the Korean people for over half a century in violation of the un charter and international law under the cloak of the \"UN Forces\" and the \"UN Command\" and mislead the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN Forces\" and the \"UN Command\" in South Korea are not offsprings of the UN Charter and a legitimate UN resolution but are camouflages faked up by the U.S. to cover up its acts of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n UNSC resolution 84 (1950) which the U.S. puts up as a legal ground for the organization of the \"UN Command\" has no legal effect as it offers no legal ground for the organization of the command and did not go through necessary procedures of voting stipulated in the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution did not say a word about organizing the command in South Korea. It only recommended that the \"unified command\" under the U.S. uses military forces and other assistance offered by the 15 satellite countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. in breach of the UNSC resolution, unilaterally renamed the \"Unified Command\" the \"UN Command\" and went to the lengths of committing military actions in defiance of the UN Charter, presenting the U.S. troops and the troops of its satellites in South Korea as \"UN Forces\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that the U.S. illegally abused the UN name in the Korean War was clearly proved by a number of testimonies made in the subsequent period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Former UN secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali in a June 24, 1994, letter addressed to the Foreign Minister of the DPRK as regards the issue of dismantling the \"UN Command\" in South Korea, said that the command had nothing to do with the un. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the 28th session of the un general assembly, delegates of many countries denounced it as illegal to call the \"U.S. Command,\" for which the UNSC is not responsible, the \"UN Command\", saying that the U.S. fabricated the UNSC resolution 84 (1950) in a bid to launch a war of aggression in Korea and attach the \"UN\" name to the U.S. troops' helmets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution which the U.S. puts forth as a legal ground for the organization of the \"UN Command\" in South Korea is an illegal document that did not go through necessary procedures for adopting decisions stipulated in the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its invalidity was brought into a bolder relief by resolution 90 of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is urgently required for peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia to take the helmets of the \"UN Forces\" and the \"UN Command\" off the U.S. troops and immediately withdraw them from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither legal ground nor justification for the U.S. to keep its aggression troops in South Korea under the \"UN\" helmets. Paragraph 60 of article 4 of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that within three months after its signing, a political conference of a higher level should be held to settle through negotiation the question of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Resolution 3390 (XXX) B which was adopted at the 30th session of the UN General Assembly provides for dismantling the \"UN Command\" and withdrawing all foreign forces under the flag of the un from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption and the publication of the \"agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression, cooperation and exchange between the north and the south\" on February 19, 1992 and the North-South Joint Declaration on June 15, 2000, in particular, opened an epochal phase for the reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south of Korea and independent national reunification, leaving the U.S. with no more pretext to maintain its troops in South Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its unseemly farce of holding the \"commemorative event\" in the name of the \"UN Command\" with no legal justification, which is intended to cover up the crimes it has committed in Korea for over half a century and deceive the international community, but withdraw its troops from South Korea at the earliest date possible and stop all its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
