            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Command of KPA Air and Anti-Air Force\r\n Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, inspected the command of the Air and Anti-Air Force of the Korean People's Army (KPA).\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greeted on the spot by Air Force Col. General Choe Yong Ho, commander of the KPA Air and Anti-Air Force, Air Force Lieut. General Son Chol Ju, political commissar of the Air and Anti-Air Force, and other commanding officers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un laid a bouquet before the statues of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il erected at the command and paid tribute to them in the humblest reverence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He recalled that the  statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, founders and builders of the Juche-oriented air force, were erected at the command of the KPA Air and Anti-Air Force before any commands of services and corps of the army on the significant day of the air force last year, adding  it was a manifestation of the noble loyalty and moral obligation of the service personnel of the Air and Anti-Air Force and all other service personnel and people to add eternal shine to their revolutionary exploits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a talk with the commanding officers of the KPA Air and Anti-Air Force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the airmen and commanding officers should think of combat awake or asleep  and handle all matters from the viewpoint of the combat preparations and correctly find out  and solve knotty problems at the highest level in the shortest possible time as required by the WPK's idea of military strategy and  tactics, Juche-oriented war methods and modern warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to intensify flight and battle drills, putting main emphasis on improving the quality of training, he said there is no need to have a drill irrelevant to actual battle even though it is conducted for a hundred, a thousand days. It is the party's intention to turn all exercises into those meeting the requirements of the modern warfare in contents, form and method and those staged under the simulated conditions of an actual battle, he noted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the comprehensive sports and cultural facilities newly built at the command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly appreciated their construction, saying the comprehensive gymnasium was designed well and constructed at a high level. Not only the construction of indoor swimming pool but also indoor volleyball and basketball courts, sauna and barber' shop are impeccable, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing satisfaction over the successful construction of the comprehensive sports and cultural facilities once again, he promised to make sure that a modern cinema is built so that the service personnel of the unit may watch movies and information on the latest military scientific and technological successes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the indoor shooting gallery newly built at the command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the command for successfully building the indoor shooting gallery and watched commanding officers' shooting. He instructed it to regularly operate the gallery to prepare all of them as crack shots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the work of the Air and Anti-Air Force for this year is well begun, he called on them to make 2015 a year of ushering in a heyday of the Air and Anti-Air Force. He specified tasks and ways for doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief and conviction that the service personnel of the unit would firmly guarantee the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms, keeping themselves fully ready for combat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the KPA General Political Bureau; Army General Hyon Yong Chol, minister of the People's Armed Forces; Han Kwang Sang, department director of the C.C., the WPK, Ri Pyong Chol, first vice department director of the C.C., the WPK, and Kim Yo Jong, vice department director of the C.C., the WPK."

            "content": "KCNA Denounces Sharing of Military Information among US, Japan, S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S., Japan and south Korea recently signed a contract on sharing information under the pretext of \"coping with nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t The contract which calls on the three parties to share in real-time information about \"nuclear and missile attacks by north Korea\" in order to promptly and effectively cope with them. The contract is reported to take effect from the very day of signing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The contract clearly proves that the military collusion and nexus among the U.S., Japan and south Korea have reached a more dangerous phase as it is a product of the U.S. strategy for dominating the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sharing of military information is aimed, first of all, at further rounding off the triangular military alliance structure for aggression, in actuality, by making a breakthrough towards establishing the triangular military alliance in Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The completion of the cooperation system in military information among the U.S., Japan and south Korea would lead to establishing and strengthening the triangular military alliance, cooperation system for a war against the DPRK and the rest of Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now seeking an unchallenged position in the Asia-Pacific region and working hard to build a barrier around big powers through the military alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The contract amounts to the first process for establishing the U.S.-led missile defense system, in actuality, and it is mainly targeted at China and Russia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has already concluded bilateral military agreements with Japan and south Korea respectively. Under this situation the U.S. attempts to ward off the influence of China and Russia in the region by establishing the triangular military cooperation system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. establishment of the system for sharing military information is timed to coincide with the frantic moves stepped up by it against Russia and China in all fields of politics, military and economy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has persistently pushed ahead with the moves for laying a siege to Russia through the building of a European missile shield and the situation in Ukraine. It has recently kicked off all-out offensive against Russia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t NATO has deployed a lot of its military bases in East European countries. Its aggressive scenario for permanent presence has entered the phase of full implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These days the U.S. is intentionally interfering in the complicated regional disputes in a bid to win neighboring countries of China to its side and lay a siege to Beijing. This is a comment of most news analysts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Sputnik News of Russia said that the U.S. is going to set up an organization similar to NATO in Asia to contain China and make Korea a \"scapegoat\" again in pushing forward this scenario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The confrontation structure is festering between China and Russia and the U.S., Japan and south Korea as the days go by owing to the U.S. aim to get hegemony in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is seriously concerned about the fact that if the U.S.-led moves to complete military alliance are put into practice, the Korean peninsula would be bound to be a springboard for the U.S. war of aggression for world domination and a theater of the same fierce scramble among world powers as what used to be in the last century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is further tightening the military collusion and nexus in the Asia-Pacific region under the pretext of non-existent \"nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK. This is a grave criminal act of extremely coiling up the tension in the region and sparking off new confrontation and arms race. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. strategy for hegemony is no longer workable as it is making a mockery of the world with the hackneyed theory about \"threats\" from the DPRK."
