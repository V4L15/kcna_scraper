The whole Korean nation should resist the U.S. war moves in a do-or-die spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should firmly unite as one to resolutely smash the U.S. moves for a war of aggression in order to protect the destiny of the nation and the future of a reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The grim reality in which the nation stands at the crossroads of a war or peace and reunification or national extermination calls on all Koreans to launch a patriotic struggle for peace against the U.S. and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever loves the nation and peace should turn out in a struggle to prevent war and save the destiny of the nation, irrespective of one's abode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas will unite close as one and decisively foil the U.S. moves for a war of aggression and thereby achieve the peace of the country and its independent and peaceful reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

These were most hideous crimes against humanity in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A special rapporteur at the meeting stressed the need for the Japanese government to admit its legal responsibility for the crimes, recognizing that the organization and operation of \"comfort women\" system was a violation of international legal duty. But Japan adamantly refused to admit its legal responsibility for them, insisting on its far-fetched assertion that \"rape committed during a war is neither a war crime nor a crime against humanity.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the special rapporteur demanded Japan deal with the historical facts about the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army in its textbooks to raise the social awareness of the issue, it deleted serious crimes including the system of \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army from history textbooks and approved at the examination those books which distorted and justified its crime-woven past. Worse still, high-ranking officials and politicians of Japan keep visiting the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" despite international community's strong protest and denunciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts are a clear indication of the Japanese authorities' stand and attitude not to admit its past atrocities as crimes. They also clearly prove that Japan has no willingness to sincerely put into practice the admonition given by the rapporteur reflecting the just demands of victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The assailants and their offspring may easily forget their past crimes but victims and their descendants will never forget the damage and pain inflicted upon them, he noted, adding that it is an unavoidable urgent legal responsibility of Japan to settle its past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
