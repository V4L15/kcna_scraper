It is only the Japanese reactionaries who still insist that the DPRK's launch of a satellite was a missile launch. \"spy infiltration\" and \"attack of guerrillas\" are nothing but fictions fabricated by them as they pleased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This diatribe launched by them is aimed to find an excuse to step up the moves to become a military power and strengthen the posture for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Japanese reactionaries revised this agreement with Korea, the first target of their overseas aggression, in mind, the commentary notes: The DPRK is closely following their maneuvers for reinvasion as they are daily escalating and going beyond the danger line. \r\n\r\n"
