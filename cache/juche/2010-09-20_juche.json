            "content": "KCNA Refutes Misinformation of Japanese Newspapers\r\n Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Sankei Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun are busy spreading wild rumors, echoing the diatribes of the Japanese right-wing reactionaries to exclude at any cost the Korean schools under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) from the government's tuition-free program for senior high schools. \n\t\t\t\t\t Sankei Shimbun claimed that the application of the above-said program to the Korean schools means \"providing Japan's public funds to the schools under the DPRK's system\" while Yomiuri Shimbun complained that \"the Korean schools have strong ties with Chongryon,\" asserting that \"the funds to be given to those schools under that program should not be illegally remitted to the DPRK\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the Korean schools in different parts of Japan have enrolled all the children of Koreans in Japan to help them grow to be persons of intellect having national consciousness and qualifications required by a modern society and strictly observed the same laws and regulations regarding the contents of education and operation of schools as other foreign schools have done. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans in Japan have the same obligation to pay taxes as the Japanese people do. Therefore, it is quite clear that the Japanese authorities should naturally give a share of them to the national education of Koreans in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology might have worked out a budget on the premises that the tuition-free program is applied to the Korean schools as is the case with Japanese senior high schools and other foreign schools. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the application of the above-said program to Korean schools expected to take effect from April was put on hold due to the opposition from the anti-DPRK conservative forces. Prompted by the stand that the application of this program should be considered in the light of \"a mere education system,\" the ministry has set about finally settling the issue in the direction of lifting the measure for excluding the Korean schools from the program.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is precisely against this backdrop that the Japanese conservative media are getting vociferous in their smear campaign against the measure. This is naturally sparking off criticism from the international public as it is nothing but reckless acts on the part of the reactionary reptile media keen on the smear campaign against the DPRK and Chongryon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a shame on the media that they are cooperating with the ultra-right conservative forces even in the matter of educating youngsters, departing from their mission to lead social development and civilization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, Sankei Shimbun and other conservative media of Japan have done every conceivable wrong, taking the lead in the Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK propaganda as pseudo media subservient to power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this behavior is the sinister intention of the reactionary reptile newspapers steeped in bitterness towards the DPRK and national chauvinism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean students in Japan are the descendants of the Koreans who were forcibly taken to Japan by the Japanese imperialists in the past and the Korean schools where they study are the legitimate institutions for national education operating with the permission of the Japanese government. Japan is under the obligation to legally and morally respect and ensure the right of the Korean students to national education in the light of the crimes the Japanese imperialists committed in the past and from an educational point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of including Korean schools in the above-said program should not be regarded as a simple financial issue of giving a petty amount of money to them or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a matter related to the viewpoint and stand of Japan toward the overseas citizens of a sovereign state and reflects part of the present Japanese authorities' hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese conservative media's reckless diatribe oblivious of this suggests that they are disqualified to steer the times."

            "content": "ATCC critica a los periodicos japoneses\r\n Pyongyang, 20 de septiembre (ATCC) -- En estos dias, los rotativos japoneses Sankei Shimbun y Yomiuri Shimbun difunden versiones erroneas sumandose a la campana de los reaccionarios derechistas de Japon para excluir a toda costa las escuelas coreanas de la Chongryon (Asociacion General de Coreanos Residentes en Japon) de la lista de las escuelas superiores donde se imparte gratuitamente la educacion a expensas del gobierno.\n\t\t\t\t\t Sankei Shimbun senalo que la educacion gratuita en las escuelas coreanas \"significa invertir los fondos publicos en las escuelas pertenecientes al sistema del Norte de Corea\". Yomiuri Shimbun reporto a su vez que las \"escuelas coreanas mantienen los lazos fuertes con la Chongryon y que los subsidios para la educacion gratuita nunca deben ser remitidos por via ilicita al Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como esta conocido, las escuelas coreanas en distintas localidades de Japon vinieron admitiendo a todos los hijos de los compatriotas coreanos residentes en Japon con el fin de formar al personal competente dotado de conciencia nacional y cualidades convenientes a la demanda de la sociedad moderna y en estricto apego a los reglamentos que rigen por igual en otras escuelas de extranjeros en cuanto al contenido didactico y a la operacion de la escuela.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los coreanos residentes en Japon tienen al igual que los habitantes japoneses la obligacion de pagar los impuestos. Por lo tanto, resulta logico que las autoridades japonesas asignen los fondos correspondientes a la educacion nacional de los coreanos residentes en su pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t De ahi que desde el principio, el Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura, Deporte, Ciencia y Tecnologia habia elaborado su presupuesto con la premisa de aplicar el sistema de subsidio tambien a las coreanas como hace con las escuelas superiores nacionales y las extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Debido a la oposicion de las fuerzas conservadoras anti-RPDC, no pudo entrar en vigor el plan de subsidiar las escuelas coreanas desde abril.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, partiendo de la concepcion de que \"la gratificacion docente debe ser analizada como mero problema de educacion\", el Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura, Deporte, Ciencia y Tecnologia ha entrado en la coordinacion final en el sentido de cancelar la medida de excluir las escuelas coreanas de la lista de las subsidiadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Justamente en estos momentos, los medios de prensa conservadores de Japon, enloquecidos por las maniobras anti-RPDC y anti-Chongryon, actuan desesperadamente para mantener vigente esa medida levantando la censura de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es una verguenza que esos periodicos venales se sumaran a las fuerzas conservadoras y ultraderechistas hasta en el problema de educacion de las generaciones venideras desviandose de su mision de encauzar el desarrollo y la civilizacion de la sociedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historicamente, los medios de prensa conservadores de Japon como Sankei Shimbun, enviciados de la hostilidad a la RPDC, la xenofobia y la aduloneria al poder, siempre estuvieron en la primera linea de la demagogia anti-RPDC de los reaccionarios japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los estudiantes coreanos residentes en Japon son los descendientes de los coreanos que habian sido arrestados y llevados por la fuerza a Japon por los imperialistas japoneses. Y sus escuelas coreanas son legitimas instituciones de educacion nacional que se operan bajo la autorizacion del gobierno japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tanto en vista de los crimenes de los imperialistas japoneses cometidos en el pasado contra el pueblo coreano como desde el punto de vista pedagogico, Japon debe respetar y asegurar legal y moralmente los derechos a la educacion nacional de los alumnos coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El subsidio a las escuelas coreanas no es un simple problema financiero, sino es un asunto relacionado con la posicion y punto de vista de Japon sobre los ciudadanos de un Estado soberano en ultramar. A la larga, este tema deviene una parte de la politica hostil a la RPDC del actual gabinete japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si los medios de prensa conservadores de Japon se han puesto tan irracionales que ya no pueden juzgar lo que pueden decir y lo que no deben, no tendrian ya la calificacion de guiar la epoca que tiene la prensa."
