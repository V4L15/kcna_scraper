For this, it is very important for the countries interested in the issue and linked to the continent to meet to discuss the issue of regional security. They are deeply interested in this security and have potentials and capacity to be responsible for their regional peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to exclude the U.S. and Japan from the debate on the issue of regional security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. is across the ocean and Japan is away from the continent, they have no interest in the peace and security of Northeast Asia nor can they own any responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both the U.S. and Japan have an ax to grind over the issue of security unlike those countries in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is possible to ensure security in Northeast Asia only when all the aggressor forces are withdrawn from this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Needless to say, it is the basic way of removing the danger of war increasing in Northeast Asia and ensuring regional security to force the U.S. to pull all its war means out of it and check Japan's moves for militarism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Samurais began the massacre of Koreans with killing Koreans, young and old, at the Pusan fort. At least 8,500 of them were beheaded, according to a record of the Japanese aggression troops in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As if it were not enough with massacring innocent Koreans, Samurais even cut off their ears and noses and took them away to Japan. The Japanese barbarians cut off even ears and noses of the peasants working in paddy and non-paddy fields, to say nothing of those of the slain Korean soldiers and took them to Japan. They also cut off ears of women in villages and even those of the sucking babies on the backs of their mothers. The ears of at least 100,000 Koreans are reportedly buried at the \"ear cemetery\" in Kyoto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that they abducted and took to Japan great many Korean technicians, specialists and innocent people in groups in broad daylight, kidnapped and took a large number of Korean women to Japan before forcing them into sexual slavery. This proves that the history of Japan's sexual slavery against Korean women dated back to the Imjin Patriotic War (1592-1598). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n About 10,000 Koreans who had been abducted by the Japanese aggression troops were repatriated to Korea according to the results of the talks to restore Korea-Japan diplomatic ties after the war. This clearly indicates how many Koreans were kidnapped to Japan in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The descendants of the Samurais imposed unheard-of misfortune and disasters upon the Korean people while pursuing the harsh colonial rule over Korea for more than 40 years after faking up the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" in November 1905 and invading it by force of arms. These are the crimes unprecedented in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will surely force Japan, the sworn enemy, to pay for its crimes generation after generation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Great Contribution to Cause of Independence\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- President Kim Il Sung is praised in the world for his great contribution to the cause of humankind's independence with the approach of his birth anniversary, the Day of the Sun (April 15)-.\r\n The Indian National Seminar on the Independent Development in the Present World was held in New Delhi recently to commemorate the Day of the Sun with the participation of prominent public figures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers at the seminar unanimously eulogized Kim Il Sung as an outstanding thinker and statesman produced by the 20th century. They said that the founding of the immortal Juche idea is the greatest of his exploits and that the idea serves as the immortal banner in the new era of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The preparatory committees formed in many countries to  commemorate the Day of the Sun are sponsoring colorful activities and newspapers and radios of different countries are editing special write-ups lauding Kim Il Sung, who made a tremendous contribution to the cause of independence, as the sun of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He embarked on the road of revolution in his early years and fathered the Juche idea in 1930 and thus performed distinguished exploits for the Korean revolution and the struggle for the liberation of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the banner of the Juche idea, he led the two wars against the U.S. and Japanese imperialists to victory, creating a brilliant example in the national liberation movement in colonies and the anti-imperialist cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the slogan \"The World People Advocating Independence, Unite!\" in reflection of the demand of the new era and clearly indicated the road to be taken by the progressive people with his great ideological and theoretical activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He authored many works including \"The Path of the Korean Revolution\" in 1930, \"Our Righteous Joint Struggle Is Victorious\" in 1952, \"The Non-aligned Movement Is a Mighty Anti-Imperialist Revolutionary Force of Our Times\" in 1975 and \"Enhancing the Role of the Popular Masses Is the Guarantee for Victory in the Cause of Independence\" in 1992. He, in the works, expounded in a comprehensive and systematic way the essence of the revolution and its historical inevitability, tasks and ways for the independence of the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the target and basic strategy of the world revolution, theory on the formation of a worldwide united front against imperalism, etc. are precious guidelines for the people of other countries who are fighting against imperialism and dominationism and for building a peaceful new world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President waged an uncompromising struggle against aggression and interference by the imperialists and all forms of dominationism infringing upon the independence of the popular masses. And he rendered unstinted spiritual and material support to the people of other countries in their national liberation struggle and efforts for economic development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For 50 years from Juche 34 (1945) to the last moments of his life, he met more than 400 party, state and government leaders of different countries for the cause of independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
