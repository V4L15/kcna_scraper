            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Refutes UNSC's \"Presidential Statement\"\r\nPyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in a recent statement vehemently refuted the UNSC's \"presidential statement\" condemning the DPRK's satellite launch. It clarified its resolute political decision that it would never participate in the six-party talks but bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The decision made by the DPRK is the most just and timely independent countermeasure to cope with the prevailing grave situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC brought the issue of the DPRK's satellite launch up for discussion and condemned it, dancing to the tune of the U.S. and its followers. This was an unpardonable rash act quite contrary to the principles of sovereign equality and impartiality, ground for the existence and activities of the UN, and outer space treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC, defying the principles of sovereign equality and impartiality, tabled and discussed the DPRK's launch of satellite for peaceful purposes although it was legitimately conducted after going through procedures under international law. This was an intolerable mockery of the Korean people and extremely hostile acts against the DPRK which can never be pardoned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary cites facts to prove that the action taken by the UNSC was the height of partiality, double-standards and arbitrary practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spirit of respect for sovereignty and sovereign equality stipulated in the September 19 joint statement for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula serves as the basis and the life and soul of the six-party talks.  The DPRK was quite just when it declared that it will never participate in the six-party talks which are reduced to a platform for encroaching upon its sovereignty and forcing it to disarm itself and bringing down its system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military threat escalated by the hostile forces, taking issue with and challenging even the satellite launch for peaceful purposes, compels the DPRK to further increase its nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defence, guarantee for the protection of the country's sovereignty, right to existence and supreme interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The day will surely come when those resorting to partiality, double-standards and arbitrary practices meet punishment of the history."

However the south Koreans' desire for independence, democracy and reunification has not yet come true.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Struggle staged by south Koreans from all walks of life has faced grave challenge due to the conservative ruling forces' wicked moves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group, which came to power crying out for the \"lost decade\", has put outside forces above the nation. It sold off the dignity and interests of the nation lock, stock and barrel, while begging its master U.S. to keep the aggressor troops in south Korea for an indefinite period and tighten \"alliance\" with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless action taken by the Lee Myung Bak regime against the country's reunification completely destroyed the foundation of the inter-Korean relations and rendered the situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula so grave that a nuclear war may break out there any moment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the appearance of the above-said regime south Korea is going back to the dark era of fascist dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mechanism and system of fascist oppression were fully restored and the freedom of speech has been crudely violated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Without do-or-die struggle the south Koreans can neither retake the sovereignty and democratic rights which were trampled down nor do away with their old misery and disgrace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the fellow countrymen at home and abroad should wage unflinching struggle to resolutely reject the anti-reunification \"policy toward the north\" pursued by the Lee group and implement the historic north-south joint declarations, united firmly under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" and thus bring earlier the independent reunification, peace and prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If all the patriotic people who value justice and aspire after the reunification of the country pool their will and efforts, irrespective of ideology, ism and the partisan interests and strategy, and firmly unite there will be nothing impossible."
