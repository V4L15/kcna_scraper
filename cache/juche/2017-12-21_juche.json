This cannot be construed otherwise than an expression of its inveterate repugnance towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As we have clearly stated on several occasions, we have nothing to do with cyber-attack and we do not feel a need to respond, on a case-by-case basis, to such absurd allegations of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, we can never tolerate the U.S. reckless move of using the issue of cyber-attack for the purpose of making direct accusation against our state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This move is a grave political provocation by the U.S. aimed at inducing the international society into a confrontation against the DPRK by tarnishing the image of the dignified country and demonizing it, as the U.S. is now driven into a corner as a result of the DPRK's achievement of great cause of completing the state nuclear force. The U.S. move is also a direct challenge to our system and political power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Crystal clear is the purpose of the U.S. trying to link us to the issue of cyber-attack at this very moment when it is hell-bent on making a harshest \"sanctions resolution\" against us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The main ulterior intention of the U.S. is to create an atmosphere of sanctions and pressure against the DPRK by branding the latter as a \"criminal state\" even in cyber issue, not being content with the nuclear issue and the \"human rights issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump administration is inciting an extremely confrontational atmosphere by even concocting a plot against us at this delicate moment when the situation on the Korean peninsula is at the crossroads of nuclear war or peace. This only betrays the true colors of the U.S. as the main culprit of the aggravated situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never tolerate the U.S. reckless moves against the DPRK and make all our efforts for defending our state and system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would also warn those countries unreasonably following in the footsteps of the U.S. indulging in the anti-DPRK plots."

Also made public was the fact that the U.S. planned to deploy AWACS and carriers Midway and Coral Sea in waters off south Korea from Kaneda U.S. air force base in Okinawa of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A commentary of Rodong Sinmun says that this points to the undeniable historical facts that the chieftain which barbarously suppressed and massacred resistance fighters of Kwangju, who turned out for democracy and independence of society and reunification of Korea, and drenched the whole of Kwangju City with blood was none other than the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality proves that the U.S. is the blood-sucking beast and a wolf in human skin as it does not hesitate to commit any shuddering massacre in order to maintain its colonial domination system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. imperialists stay in south Korea, its people can not evade the second and third Kwangju disaster and the desire of Kwangju resistance fighters for independence, democracy and reunification can never come true. The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces, the root cause of all misfortune and pain of south Koreans and all sorts of disasters faced by them, have to be withdrawn at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have to face up to the desire and will of the people for independence and democracy, justice and progress and get rid of old bad habit of sycophancy toward the U.S."

This was a planned politically-motivated terrorist act to deliberately suppress Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more serious is that the suppression was carried out at a time when all the officials of Chongryon and all the Koreans in Japan were wrapped in the memorial feelings on the occasion of the 6th anniversary of demise of leader Kim Jong Il. This fact alone is enough to prove that the search by the Japanese authorities was a sinister provocation aimed at meeting a political purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says the more frantically the Japanese reactionaries resort to suppression of Chongryon despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the higher price they will be made to pay, and that the responsibility will rest with the Japanese authorities in entirety."
