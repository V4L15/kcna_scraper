That is why all the lines and policies of the Workers' Party of Korea have always displayed their great vitality, winning absolute support and sympathy from all the people and socialist construction in the DPRK could advance along the road of victory without any turns and twists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In every hard time, the President trusted in people and gave confidence in sure victory and courage to them to bring about great upsurge. His leadership made it possible to create a heroic epic about miracles of Chollima Korea and helped the DPRK emerge a socialist power independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regarding it as his greatest pleasure to always go among the people, he would make an endless journey to visit them in disregard of weathers or red-letter days. This journey resulted in great happiness of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our socialist country built by the President is the cradle of eternal life and happiness of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are the most dignified people as they have enjoyed happiness and comfort generation after generation in the powerful and prosperous socialist country centered on the popular masses under the guidance of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the miracle of history that a strong springboard for building a great prosperous powerful nation was provided and the era of great prosperity opened up in this land thanks to the leadership of Kim Jong Il who has devoted his all to prosperity of the country associated with the whole life of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, the glorious motherland founded by Kim Il Sung and led by Kim Jong Il, is, indeed, the cradle of the Korean people's independent life and happiness and the banner of victory and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The validity and vitality of the idea have been clearly proved in the reality of the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever is a member of the Korean nation should find the worth and pride of leading a true human life in working hard to realize the desire of the fellow countrymen for reunification. Every Korean, no matter where and what he or she does, should make a tangible contribution to the cause of national reunification as the one responsible for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This finds a vivid manifestation in the bankruptcy of its policy of aggression and war and the new change that has taken place in the balance of forces in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' policy of aggression and war is meeting a failure and frustration in face of the struggle of the people to carve out their destinies independently, taking a firm grip on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The balance of forces in the world has turned more favorable to the side of the revolution, the side of forces for progress and independence and the anti-imperialist independent forces have grown definitely stronger than the imperialist reactionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialist process of going to decline and ruin can find its expression in the serious economic crisis sweeping the capitalist world. The article cites the following facts to prove this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the deepening economic crisis, the political crisis and social contradictions have grown more acute in the capitalist countries and the rivalry among the imperialist powers to secure markets and expand the sphere of their influence is getting fiercer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Western countries are getting more undisguised in their \"trade war\" and \"oil dispute\" to meet their interests by sacrificing other countries and confrontation and clash surrounding the international monetary crisis are festering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-imperialist independent forces, the mainstream of the era, are winning one victory after another while the imperialist reactionary forces are being driven to a tight corner, hit hard by the people.  Nothing can stop imperialism from going to decline and ruin just as it can never turn back the wheel of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
