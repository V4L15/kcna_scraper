They should properly know that from this moment the first-strike combined units of the KPA keep themselves fully ready to mount a preemptive retaliatory strike at all enemy attack groups involved in Ulji Freedom Guardian.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The nuclear warmongers should bear in mind that if they show the slightest sign of aggression on the inviolable land, seas and air where the sovereignty of the DPRK is exercised, it would turn the stronghold of provocation into a heap of ashes through Korean-style preemptive nuclear strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will hold their bayonets more tightly to annihilate the enemies in the future, too, in order to put a definite end to the nuclear war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   It is the resolute determination and will of the Paektusan revolutionary armed forces to terminate the ever more reckless moves of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces for a nuclear war not temporarily but indefinitely. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We once again declare that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK with remarkably increased capability for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack of Korean style are waiting for a historic chance to blow up all strongholds of aggression and war and liberate the southern half of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear warmongers should not forget the iron will of the KPA even a moment."

Y las entidades de diferentes estratos del Sur de Corea, las organizaciones de la ONU y las entidades internacionales de DDHH también urgen fuertemente la \"entrevista con abogados\" de las secuestradas y el encuentro de ellas con sus familiares, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las autoridades surcoreanas retienen injustamente por más de 4 meses a nuestras ciudadanas raptadas en colectivo engañando a la opinión pública como si fuera la \"fuga voluntaria del Norte\" y librando la operación de \"sumisión\". Y hace poco, anunciaron que \"asentaron a ellas en la sociedad surcoreana\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo consideramos como un sucio complot para eludir las críticas internas y externas sobre la retención forzada y la presión de la opinión pública, que exige la devolución incondicional, y ocultar la verdad del horrible crimen de secuestro colectivo, cometido por el Servicio de Inteligencia del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas dicen por una parte que \"las empleadas norcoreanas tienen la posición de persona libre\" y por la otra, no dan a la publicidad la situación personal de ellas prohibiendo el contacto con los medios de prensa bajo el pretexto de la \"protección de seguridad\", lo cual demuestra que es una mentira pura el anuncio arriba mencionado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo más indignante es que la Sociedad de la Cruz Roja del Sur de Corea, que profesa la \"solución del problema de familiares separados\" y la cooperación humanitaria entre el Norte y el Sur, hace vista gorda del proceder inhumanitario de las autoridades surcoreanas que intentan separar por la fuerza a las ciudadanas norcoreanas de sus queridos padres y familiares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGuardar silencio y cruzarse de brazos ante la actitud antihumanitaria y antiética de las autoridades dan lo mismo que cobijarla.
