            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Slams Park Geun Hye's Provocative Remarks against DPRK's Nuclear Deterrence\r\n Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- Park Geun Hye of south Korea spat out invectives at a meeting on June 6 that the DPRK's nuclear deterrence is \"a great provocation disturbing the peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world and a hurdle lying in the way of national concord and unification\". She blustered that south Korea would \"keep escalating sanctions and pressure by pursuing cooperation with the international community\". She went the lengths of raving that south Korea would \"maintain the joint defence posture\" with the U.S. to make someone suffer \"self-destruction.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the south Korean chief executive uttered is nothing but sheer sophism making profound confusion of right and wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear deterrence serves not only as a treasured sword of justice which protects peace and stability on the Korean peninsula from the U.S. moves to ignite a nuclear war and contributes to peace in Northeast Asia and other parts of the world but also as a treasure common to the Korean nation as it protects the destiny of the nation and ensures its prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is thanks to the DPRK's powerful nuclear deterrence for self-defence that a war has not broken out on the peninsula despite the U.S. reckless threat of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. does not conceal its uneasiness and fear in face of the fact that the DPRK's self-defensive nuclear deterrence is further bolstered up both in quality and quantity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bombast made by Park for \"stern counteraction\" and \"self-destruction,\" while kowtowing to the U.S., is no more than a ridiculous act of precipitating her final doom. Because she is unaware of her impending miserable fate in which she will have to take her last breath in face of the tremendous might of the Korean People's Army and its counter-action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park would be well advised to properly understand what is going on in the world and behave herself, though belatedly, rather than doing harm to south Korea and precipitating her self-ruin by insisting on her ambition to force the \"north to dismantle its nukes\", concludes the commentary."

The Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea took place early in May for the first time since 1980. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. government should not underestimate the DPRK's nuclear capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no way for the U.S. to stop the DPRK's nuclear program. In case a war against it breaks out, this will not be confined to the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a noteworthy comment as it truthfully reflects the reality today when the balance of force between the DPRK and the U.S. has completely changed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's international prestige and influence have remarkably risen. The DPRK is demonstrating its might as a nuclear power possessed of even H-bomb.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the U.S. could threaten and blackmail the DPRK, non-nuclear weapon state, with nukes. But, the DPRK, which ranks itself among nuclear powers, is putting pressure upon the U.S. through its powerful military muscle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation goes to clearly prove once again that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is an anachronistic one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has to choose between two strategic options: To put a definite end to its hostile policy toward the DPRK or allow its mainland to suffer a nuclear disaster and to be wiped off the surface of this planet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to properly recognize the status of the DPRK as a nuclear power and face up to the trend of the times, though belatedly, and opt to roll back its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK as early as possible."

Under this plan, development and tourism are to be conducted simultaneously in the areas of Wonsan, Masikryong Ski Resort, Ullim Falls, Sokwang Temple, Thongchon and Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the Wonsan area, there are the Songdowon International Children's Camp, Songdowon Beach and Songdowon Hotel, etc. The Masikryong Ski Resort area has ten skiing courses, skating ground and Masikryong Hotel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ullim Falls area extending 1,000 hectares has scenic spots like Kusul (beads) and Pidan (silk) falls and ponds.
