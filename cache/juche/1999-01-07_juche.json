            "content": "KANPC indicts U.S. imperialists for violating Geneva agreement  \r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean Anti-Nuke Peace Committee today made public an indictment to clearly disclose how the United States has violated the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework reached in Geneva and how seriously the violation has threatened the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and hindered the DPRK's socialist economic construction.\r\n   The indictment comes as the United States is these days creating greater military threats to the DPRK, crying that the DPRK has violated the Geneva agreement by building a \"suspected underground nuclear facility.\"\r\n   The indictment said:\r\n   On October 21, 1994, the DPRK and the United States of America held talks on comprehensive solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in Geneva and signed an agreed framework.\r\n   In the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework called the Geneva agreement, the sides promised to solve the nuclear issue and came to terms on matters of principle arising in the DPRK-U.S. relations.\r\n   Four odd years have passed since the adoption of the agreement. But, the United States has implemented none of the items agreed on by the two countries.\r\n   Facts clearly show the United States is the violator of the Geneva agreement.\r\n   The ground for the two light-water reactors, which the U.S. is obliged to hand over to the DPRK on a turn-key basis after completing them in a responsible way by the year 2003, has not been broken satifactorily even today when nearly half of the set time has elapsed. Accordingly, the full-scale project is so vague that no one can say when it will Be begun and completed.\r\n   Shipments of heavy oil have also been delayed owing to the U.S. insincere implementation of its obligation.\r\n   In the Geneva agreement, the U.S. is obliged to ease bans on trade and investment. However, it has tightened economic sanctions, groundlessly including the DPRK in the \"list of sponsors of terrorism.\"\r\n   The indictment documented the fact that the Geneva agreement has not been fully implemented because the United States and its followers have pursued the anti-DPRK suffocation strategy and confrontation policies.\r\n   It went on to say:\r\n   The United States signed the Geneva agreement not because it was truly concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons or interested in the improvement of the DPRK-U.S.relations and the peace and security of the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The real reason is that, unable to stifle the DPRK with strength, the U.S. foolishly planned to put off the time with light-water reactors as a bait so as to block the development of the DPRK's  self-reliant nuclear power industry, weaken its economic and military potentials and thus \"wither\" and \"destroy\" the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. moves to delay implementing the Geneva agreement have created four years of vacuum in the development of our self-supporting nuclear power industry and caused a great shortage of energy, thus having a serious effect on  our socialist planned economy as a whole.\r\n   Direct losses caused by them amount to tens of billions of dollars.\r\n   If the project of building our self-supporting nuclear power industrial base had been promoted as planned, it would have been completed by this time and, accordingly,  there would have been no shortage in the supply of energy and our socialist economy would have produced a great fruition.\r\n   In the long run, what we have gained in \"reward\" for faithfully implementing the Geneva agreement are nothing but economic losses.\r\n   It is  common sense in view of international law or usage that if one side does harm to the other side by violating an agreement, it should make compensation or reparation for the losses.\r\n   The United States has the obligation and responsibility to make compensation for the economic losses inflicted upon the DPRK and must pay for them in any form.\r\n   The present economic difficulties of the Korean people are wholly ascribable to the wrong Korea policy of the U.S. the frantic racket of the United States and its followers over \"suspected underground nuclear facility\" and their military threats against the DPRK mean the abandonment of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, a declaration of war and provocation against the DPRK. If the U.S., approaching the Geneva agreement with insincerity, continues to delay implementing it although it promised before the world, the DPRK also has no intention of observing it, suffering only losses. The DPRK is fully ready to cope with a declaration of abandonment of the agreement, a declaration of war or any provocation. If the U.S. finally imposes military confrontation in violation of the Geneva agreement, the DPRK will unhesitatingly counter it and not miss the opportunity to wreak the pent-up grudge of national division and accomplish the cause of national reunification.\r\n   The United States, the South Korean authorities, the Japanese reactionaries and other followers will never flee from the responsibility for violating the Geneva agreement.\r\n   They would be well advised to clearly see what consequences will occur and stop running rashly. \r\n\r\n \r\n"

In the tawdry literature the  Ministry of National Defense growled forth imprecation on the dignified political system in the north, the imprecation which cannot be pardoned at all.\r\n   It is a well-known fact that while engaging themselves in anti-DPRK diatribe, they have screwed up inter-Korean rivalry through an unbroken chain of provocation. Their recent anti-DPRK diatribe, the climax of those provocation, means that they declared a total showdown with the north, throwing off the hypocritical veil of \"dialogue\" and \"exchange.\" \r\n   The South Korean authorities seek in this to prevent the officers and men of the \"rok\" army from sympathizing with North Korea. They should be mindful that their anti-north smear campaign is a foolish act which will only precipitate their destruction.\r\n   The Korean people and people's army consider that to devotedly defend the socialist homeland, their destiny and future is life and soul. To this end they are not squeamish in their choice of means and methods.\r\n   Hawks of the South Korean military deserve a retaliatory punishment for their grisliest crime ever known in history.\r\n   The people's army keep an eye on their every movement. \r\n\r\n"
