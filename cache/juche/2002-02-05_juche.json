            "content": "Bush's accusation against DPRK under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Recently U.S.  President  Bush    in a \"state of the union address\" at the congress let loose a spate of such vituperation as listing the DPRK as a \"member of the axis of evil\" and \"the most dangerous  U.S.  regime in the world.\" He openly revealed his dangerous U.S.     design to seize the DPRK by force of arms, groundlessly linking it with terrorism.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a by-lined commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There has been no precedent in the modern history of DPRK-U.S. relations that  Bush    openly threatened the DPRK with aggression. This is little short of declaring a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that the U.S.  attempts to designate the DPRK as a target of its military operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, it will be a fatal blunder for the U.S.  to ignite a new war on the Korean peninsula. The DPRK is neither Afghanistan nor Yugoslavia nor Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people is the heroic people who inflicted the first disgraceful defeat upon the U.S. in history which regards war as its main job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the army-centered leadership of the great brilliant commander the DPRK is equipped with both powerful offensive and defensive means capable of dealing deadly blows to any aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No aggressors attempting to seize the DPRK will be able to go back alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our revolutionary armed forces have unlimited striking power and no aggressors against the DPRK will go safe no matter where they are on earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Option to \"strike\" on the lips of the U.S. is not its monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's army and people of Korea will wipe out all aggressors coming to infringe upon their dignity with a thousand-fold merciless retaliatory strike.    \r\n\r\n"

Commenting on it, Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is sophism of totally reversing white and black. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. that is to blame for having turned northeast Asia into the world's biggest hotspot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has staged military exercises in South Korea almost every day in a bid to stifle the DPRK militarily after deploying all types of military equipment including nuclear weapons and huge aggression forces there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unanimous view of the international community that there exists on the Korean peninsula a \"threat of war to invade the north\", not \"southward invasion\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Threat from China\" is a sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Plainly speaking, the U.S. is telling such a lie in a bid to realize its attempt to perpetuate its military presence in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anti-U.S. sentiment is mounting in South Korea after the whole truth about GIs' mass killings of civilians in Rogun-ri was brought to light and the issue of transferring the U.S. military base in Ryongsan, Seoul, surfaced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upset by this, the U.S. takes issue with the DPRK and china in a bid to calm down the anti-U.S. sentiment of the South Korean people and invent a pretext for the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to know that with no sophism can it achieve its ulterior aim.    \r\n\r\n"
