The 21st century, in which global independence will be realized, will shine as Kim Jong Il's era both in name and reality, he stressed.\r\n   President of the Council Seiichi Sakugawa, in his keynote report, extended warm congratulations to Kim Jong Il on his election as WPK General Secretary, saying the election is an event not only the Korean people but also the members of societies for the study of the Juche idea wished so ardently.\r\n   He said the man-centred Juche idea was fathered by President Kim Il Sung and comprehensively systematized and developed in depth by General Secretary Kim Jong Il. The idea serves as a highly important guideline propelling the Korean revolution, he added.\r\n   Then, professor of Saitama University Takao Kamakura made a report on the study of Kim Jong Il's celebrated work \"On Preserving the Juche Character and National Character of the Revolution and Construction\".\r\n   A letter to General Secretary Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting, which said:\r\n   \"The participants in the national meeting are convinced that with your excellency Kim Jong Il elected as General Secretary and as supreme leader of Korea both in name and reality, a great progress will be made in socialist construction and reunification of Korea and in the cause of global independence.\"    \r\n\r\n"

And it is not beneficial to the United States, either.\r\n   It will only result in self-destruction of the warmaniacs.\r\n   If the warmongers at home and abroad persist in war moves and encroach upon our sovereignty in the least in disregard of our repeated warning, our people and army will mete out thousandfold merciless punishment to the aggressors.    \r\n\r\n"

General Assembly Session \r\n  Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- A DPRK delegate made a speech on the issue of disarmament and international security at the first committee meeting of the 52nd United Nations General Assembly Session.\r\n   He declared that the DPRK government will perform its international responsibility and role in the struggle to build a new world, nuclear-free, peaceful and independent.   he further said:\r\n   \"Attempts to keep the nuclear weapons and produce new ones with outcries for 'nuclear deterrent policy' today when the Cold War has come to an end cannot be justified under any circumstances.\r\n   \"Nuclear reduction must be cardinal to disarmament and nuclear disarmament must lead to the complete demolition of nuclear weapons.\r\n   \"This is why the DPRK delegation supports the call for the 4th special meeting of the U.N. General Assembly on disarmament and this meeting should mainly discuss the issue of nuclear reduction.\r\n   \"Nuclear-weapon nations must completely stop tests and production of nuclear weapons and give assurances to the non-nuclear countries that they would not use nuclear weapons under any circumstances.\r\n   \"And they must present a specific timetable for demolishing nuclear weapons and unconditionally abide by it.\r\n   \"The DPRK delegation considers that the action plan which was submitted by the DPRK and 27 other non-aligned movement member nations at a disarmament meeting held in August last year must constitute a basis for negotiations on nuclear reduction.\r\n   \"Regional peace and security plays an important role in securing international security.\r\n   \"Now, an instable situation persists in northeast Asia.\r\n   \"This is ascribable to the military collusion and arms race among outside forces.\r\n   \"The DPRK delegation warns the international community that scrambles among big powers to monopolize the munitions market of south Korea may endanger the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and, at the same time, calls upon all the peaceloving nations to heighten their vigilance against double-dealing acts of big powers which are earning money through arms dealings, styling themselves as defenders of peace and security.\r\n   \"To ensure peace and security in the Korean Peninsula is directly linked with peace and security in northeast Asia and in the rest of the world.\"\r\n   The DPRK delegate stressed that a new peace mechanism must be established on the Korean Peninsula and the U.S. troops must be withdrawn from south Korea and that the United Nations must direct due attention to the implementation of the resolution of the 30th U.N.

            "content": "Improper behaviour of Germany \r\n   Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- Germany is these days behaving unreasonably over the reunification issue of the Korean Peninsula, siding with the south Korean puppets.\r\n   According to a report, a few days ago, the German Foreign Minister visited south Korea where he exchanged opinions about the situation on the Korean Peninsula with south Korean puppets and agreed to regularly hold what they called \"consultative meeting on reunification\". In this connection, BBC reported that Germany and south Korea agreed on setting up an \"organisation for negotiation on Korea's reunification formula\" and the first meeting would be held at the beginning of next year.\r\n   Earlier, in July, the Secretary of State of the Foreign Ministry of Germany, during his tour of south Korea, showed up even at the U.S. forces command stationed in south Korea and chatted about \"peace talks\". He reportedly met with officials of the south Korean puppet administration and businessmen and agreed on relevant issues.\r\n   Worse still, German authorities prattled that the German government is ready to give \"advices\" to south Korea on the basis of its experience in reunification.\r\n   These facts show that the German authorities, having no proper view of the issue of Korea's reunification, are imprudently uttering words which may have a negative influence on the issue, poking their noses into it.\r\n   We cannot but approach with vigilance their wrong attitude toward the issue of Korea's reunification because it is a criminal act which incites inter-Korean confrontation and encourages the foolish design of the south Korean authorities who are making desperate efforts to realise \"unification by absorption\" at any cost.\r\n   Issues of reunification of Korea and Germany differ from each other from the historical and political points of view. \r\nAccordingly, Germany's experience in reunification cannot serve as a \"basis\" and \"advice\" in solving the issue of Korea's reunification.\r\n   Korea is not a defeated nation or an \"enemy state\" which was divided after being defeated in war of aggression.\r\n   Korea's reunification has been delayed, not because there are no reasonable proposals and ways for reunification.\r\n   We have the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, the most reasonable and fairest one for reunification whose validity has been recognised by the world.\r\n   Korea has not yet been reunified because the south Korean puppets who are not in the least concerned about the destiny of the nation and the reunification of the country, shunning this realistic proposal for reunification, have turned inter-Korean relations into relations of extreme antagonism and committed war provocation moves against the DPRK in concert with outsiders. What they seek in this is to find a way out of their ruling crisis in the aggravation of tension and confrontation.\r\n   The frantic large-scale foal eagle war game now under way in south Korea is a living example of this.\r\n   The behaviour shown by the German authorities at this very juncture cannot be construed otherwise than unreasonable intervention which fosters political and military confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and throws a wet blanket over the ardent desire of the Korean people for independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.\r\n   The German authorities would be well advised to respect the sovereignty of our nation and its will for reunification and stop imprudently interfering in the reunification issue related to the destiny and general interests of the Korean nation and in touchy political matters, siding with the south Korean authorities.    \r\n\r\n"

The old man in his seventies is playing the role of servant of the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP).\r\n   He is groundlessly slandering the north with sheer lies and lacerating the hearts of the fellow countrymen, who are suffering from division.\r\n   Words of students who have been to Beijing to participate in a world peace forum of youth and students in September have brought his ugly colors into bolder relief.\r\n   Born into a landlord's family, he enjoyed every possible democratic benefit in academic and political circles in the north. But he has the cheek to call this democratic society a dictatorial society.\r\n   Especially, his lies about the Juche idea anger all people. His insult to the Juche idea proves that he is lacking in faith and conscience.\r\n   If he had faith in truth and human conscience, he would not have defected to the society that he had criticised as a \"colony and puppet\" and would not have slandered the Juche idea, which he had \"worshipped\" in the past, and the society where he had lived well.\r\n   With a view to impairing the bright image of the north, inciting hostile feeling toward the north and obstructing peace and peaceful reunification, he even said that Mt. Kumgang has been devastated.\r\n   He is now playing the role of shock force of the separatists who impede inter-Korean reconciliation, unity, cooperation and exchange.\r\n   In his \"lecture\" before the participants in the Beijing forum and in his \"lecture\" before university presidents in August, for instance, Hwang described the university presidents in the north as puppets and said there was no need to meet or contact with them. The paranoiac Hwang pretended to be ignorant of the real puppets in south Korea such as Pak Hong, president of Sogang University.\r\n   He called for \"resolutely punishing\" the students of south Korea involved in the reunification movement. He described them as \"traitors to the nation\" and their struggle as \"stupid action.\"\r\n   At a recent unofficial symposium, he called for wiping out the dissident forces in different circles of south Korea as soon as possible because the north thinks they will join hands with the north in case of invasion of south Korea.\r\n   Hwang is a cancer harmful to the nation and reunification. He is enemy both to the north and the south. \r\nIt is not patriotic students but Hwang Jang Yop who must be removed from this land at an early date.\r\n   The \"Agency for National Security Planning\" is the fool of fools in that it employs this idiot as its servant.\r\n   Hwang's anti-north rhapsody will turn out to be dirge for the \"ANSP\" and \"Chongwadae.\"    \r\n\r\n"
