The June 15 era of reunification shines as an era of the unity and reunification of the Korean nation. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification is an era in which \"By our nation itself\", the idea of national independence and unity, guides the national history and in which the Koreans are promoting the common interests of the nation through wide-range cooperation and exchange between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have smashed the vicious obstructive moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad through national cooperation guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" over the last several years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wide-ranging exchange and cooperation between the north and the south in different fields including various fabrics of social life such as politics, economy, culture and sports firmly convinced the Koreans of the truth that they have the same blood, history, culture and tradition and if they distrust each other and stand in confrontation with each other, this will only do harm to themselves and give foreign forces a chance to fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification is an era of a nationwide movement for reunification as it calls on all the fellow countrymen to work together to bring earlier the day of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The will and stamina of the Koreans to achieve the independent reunification of the nation have been strikingly demonstrated by grand festivals for national reunification held with splendor with representatives of political parties and social organizations, figures and people of all strata of the north and the south and Korean overseas attending and inter-Korean meetings of people from all walks of life including workers, peasants, youth and students held in Pyongyang, Seoul and Mt. Kumgang resort one after another since the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The All-Korean Committee for Implementation of June 15 Joint Declaration formed as a permanent organization of the solidarity movement for national reunification last year is functioning as an umbrella body for solidarity among Koreans in the north and the south and overseas.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The issues ranges from the work to hold President Kim Il Sung in high esteem to the fundamental principles and methods of Party building and activities, the unity and cohesion of the Party, Juche-oriented Party work system and methods and the guidance to the Party life of the members. And he has wisely led the efforts for realizing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward the program on Party building for imbuing the Juche idea into the whole party and society and took revolutionary measures for strengthening the Party organizationally and ideologically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has authored many famous works to brightly light the orientation and ways for the Party building and work. Among them are \"On Further Improving Party Ideological Work,\" \"On the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building\" and \"Giving Priority to Ideological Work is Essential for Accomplishing Socialism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The years are shining with his great efforts to defend the revolutionary tradition as the life-line of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his guidance, statues of the President have been erected in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While making a long inspection tour of army units, he visited the revolutionary battle sites of Mt. Paektu and other places to intensify the education in the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il ushered in the heyday in the economic, cultural and other fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He defined the principle of speed campaign, which was created in the 1960s when he led the work of the literary and art fields, as the main form of the socialist construction and initiated many mass movements such as 70-day campaign, a 100-day campaign, Three-revolution Red Flag Movement and the Campaign to Follow the Example of the Unassuming Heroes. As a result, world-startling miracles and innovations have been worked out in all the fields of the economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large Oxygen Separator and a 10,000ton press were manufactured and many monumental edifices including the world leading West Sea Barrage, the Tower of Juche Idea and the Arch of Triumph were built in a campaign to create the speed of the 80's following the spirit displayed in the 1970s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of creations have been constructed in the 1990s and in the new century even under the unspeakable difficulties and trials. Among them are power stations, modernized and special factories, stock-farms, Kwangmyongsong Saltern, Youth Hero Motorway and the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong and Paekma-Cholsan Waterways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arable land has been realigned to suit the socialist countryside of Korea and innovations taken place in the farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proud successes have been registered in the construction of socialist culture, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mass gymnastic and artistic display \"Arirang,\" which was the acme of the \"Renaissance in the 20th century\", the launch of the artificial satellite \"Kwangmyongsong-1\" which powerfully demonstrated the might of the socialist Korea, the construction of recreation grounds including Mt. Chilbo and Ryongmun Cavern and the brisk mass artistic activities substantiate the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the last ten-odd years takes a special position in the history of his 40-odd year leadership over the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days, he creditably defended the destiny of socialist Korea with his unique Songun politics and invariably upheld the revolutionary red flag as the President did in his lifetime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, over the last four decades, he has performed undying revolutionary exploits for the eternal prosperity of the Kim Il Sung's nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also throws another stumbling block in the efforts to improve the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionary conservative forces of Japan have persistently used abduction and human rights issues for their political purposes, far from exerting sincere efforts for the implementation of the declaration since its publication. They have instead incited hostility toward the DPRK and put sanctions and pressure upon it, virtually pushing the bilateral relations to the lowest ebb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that new regulations on the portcall of Mangyongbong-92 was enforced although it serves the humanitarian purpose of helping Koreans in Japan visit their homeland and unwarranted searches of institutions related to Chongryon were perpetrated and fixed property taxes were levied upon them under the pretext of \"strict application of the existing law\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rights of the Koreans in Japan should be protected as they suffered exploitation and big sacrifices under the colonial rule of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that the bill is bound to threaten the elementary rights and right to existence of the Koreans in Japan including their freedom to visit homeland and restrict their business activities and intensify the suppression and exploitation of them. The bill is, therefore, intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The enforcement of such hostile and provocative bill to increase the pressure upon the DPRK would becloud the prospect of solving pending issues between the DPRK and Japan and exacerbate the tension between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nam Sung U urged the Japanese authorities to roll up their hostile policy toward the DPRK, halt their suppression of Koreans in Japan and the unwarranted enforcement of regulations against them and sincerely implement the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
