            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Programme for Korea's Reunification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 17 (KCNA) -- The June 15 joint declaration serves as an action programme common to the nation and a banner of victory that all Koreans should always hold fast to in the movement for national reunification at present, says Rodong Sinmun today in a by-lined article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration elucidates the fundamental principles which call on the Koreans responsible for solving the question of national reunification to independently settle it by their concerted efforts, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" enshrined in the declaration is based on the principle of national independence. Only when this principle of independence, the principle calling for resolutely standing against outsiders' domination and intervention, flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders, is adhered to, is it possible for the Korean nation to successfully achieve the cause of national reunification in keeping with its demand and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said idea presupposes the great unity of the entire nation. Without this unity for strengthening the driving force for national reunification, it is hard to expect victory in the cause of national reunification accompanied by a fierce struggle against the anti-reunification forces. The great unity of the entire nation constitutes powerful strength for shaping the nation's destiny independently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" is basically required for achieving the above-said unity. Therefore, differences in ideology, ism, political view, religious belief, classes and strata should not be absolutized in the matter of achieving the great national unity in the above-said idea. When primary consideration is given to the destiny of the nation and the reunification of the country, its common interests, is put above anything else, such differences can neither be problematic nor be obstructive to achieving the great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration also comprehensively indicates the tasks and ways for realizing national reconciliation and unity and reunifying the country as it calls for solving humanitarian matters between the north and the south of Korea, developing the nation's economy in a balanced way through their economic cooperation and building confidence between the two sides through brisk cooperation and exchange in the social, cultural, sports, health and environmental and various other fields.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The world people desirous of independence are the driving force for accomplishing the human cause of independence. Only when the world people firmly unite and cooperate with one another under the banner of independence, is it possible to increase the force for independence and surely frustrate any move of the counter-revolutionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international slogan calling on the world people advocating independence to unite reflects the common aspiration of all the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe world people advocating independence should counter the imperialists' moves for division and alienation and strategy for destroying them one by one with the strategy of unity and solidarity. Herein lies the key to winning a victory in the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the world progressives firmly unite and cooperate with one another under the banner of independence, the moves of the imperialist and reactionary forces for domination are bound to go bust and the cause of global independence is sure to win one victory after another.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
