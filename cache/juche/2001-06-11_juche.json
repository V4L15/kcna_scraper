            "content": "Anecdotes about President Kim Il Sung (2) \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- There is an anecdote about President Kim Il Sung's mealtime.\r\n One day in Autumn Juche 71 (1982), the President left his lodgings early in the morning to give on-site guidance to a certain unit and came back at 2:50 p.m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When a waiter was guiding him to a dining room, the president said that he had no time as there were many people waiting for a meeting to start at 15:00. Asking only for one cup of water, he said, \"the meeting time should be observed, though my lunch is skipped.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he soothed the impatient feeling of the waiter, saying he would take his meal after the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another anecdote tells about a half-underground house which he used as his residence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was one day right after the Fatherland Liberation War (1950-1953). An official told the president coming home at dawn that they would build at once a residence for him who was living in a half-underground house. But, the President advised him not to do so, saying he should share sweets  and bitters with the people as he did in the wartime. when the people live in houses on the ground, we can live in such house, he added. after all, he spent Juche 43 (1954) New Year's day in that cold and damp half-underground house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is one more anecdote about a habit of babies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In August of a year the president visited a nursery of a factory while giving on-site guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Babies began to cry perhaps as it was the time to give the breast to them. Nurses were at a loss while carrying them in arms. At that moment, the President told the nurses not to do so frequently, saying that babies would cry when they feel pleasant and unpleasant or sleepy. it is a habit of babies to cry, he added.    \r\n\r\n"

This was a provocation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its refusal was a very shameless and maladroit act perpetrated in contravention of international morality and ethics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What cannot be overlooked is that Japan has undisguisedly revealed its hostility toward the DPRK before the international community by refusing the entry of the delegation of the DPRK only, the no. 1 victim of the Japanese imperialists' aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities frequently call for \"improved relations\" with the DPRK, but, in actuality, do not bother to commit reckless and provocative acts quite contrary to such call. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should be mindful that the refusal only adds to the crimes already committed by them against the Korean people and that this will add fuel to their anti-Japanese sentiment and further isolate Japan from the world community.    \r\n\r\n"
