aniversario de la fundacion de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t Asistieron Kim Yong Nam, Pak Pong Ju, Choe Ryong Hae y otros cuadros directivos del partido, el Estado y el ejercito, los presidentes de partidos amigos, los diputados a la Asamblea Popular Suprema, los funcionarios de los organismos del partido, las fuerzas armadas y el poder, entidades sociales, ministerios y organos centrales, los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular de Corea y del Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea, los funcionarios de las instituciones de ciencia, educacion, literatura y arte, salud publica, prensa e informacion, benemeritos laborales, trabajadores capitalinos, compatriotas y delegaciones y grupos de visita en la patria socialista y el representante de la sucursal del Frente Democratico Nacional Antiimperialista en Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fueron invitados representantes diplomaticos y de organizaciones internacionales y agregados militares, acreditados en Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El informe de la ocasion estuvo a cargo de Kim Yong Nam, miembro del Presidium del Buro Politico del Comite Central del PTC y presidente del Presidium de la APS de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El informante destaco que la RPDC es el Estado socialista de tipo jucheano, que brilla por la original idea y las proezas de direccion del Presidente Kim Il Sung y del Dirigente Kim Jong Il en materia de la construccion del Estado, y sirve de fuerte arma que garantiza la dignidad independiente del pueblo coreano y la prosperidad nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues de la liberacion de la patria, el Presidente asento la firme base de la construccion de un Estado independiente y soberano, y a base de ello, proclamo el 9 de septiembre del 37 (1948) de la Era Juche la  fundacion de la RPDC, recordo y continuo: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La fundacion de la RPDC fue un gran acontecimiento historico que permitio al pueblo coreano tener por primera vez en la historia nacional de cinco milenios su verdadera patria y disfrutar de una vida libre y feliz como dueno del poder estatal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bajo la probada y destacada guia del Presidente y del Dirigente, la RPDC se ha fortalecido como potencia socialista invicta enarbolando la bandera revolucionaria del Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La RPDC es el verdadero pais del pueblo que encarna con brillantez el noble ideario Iminwichon (considerar al pueblo como el cielo) de los grandes Generalisimos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estos grandes hombres hicieron que el poder de la Republica tomara Iminwichon como ideal fundamental de la construccion del Estado y subordinaran todas sus lineas y politicas y actividades a defender las demandas e intereses de las masas populares y a asegurar al pueblo suficientes condiciones de vida material y cultural. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gracias a la probada orientacion de ellos, la RPDC ha materializado satisfactoriamente la politica de amor y confianza en el pueblo, de modo que todo el pais se convierta en una gran familia armoniosa y unida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La RPDC es el Estado socialista con fuerte caracter Juche y la nacionalidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Presidente y el Dirigente tomaron por el principio fundamental mantener el caracter Juche, la nacionalidad y la linea independiente en la construccion y actividades del Estado y condujeron sabiamente las labores para llevarlo a cabo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La RPDC es la potencia del monte Paektu que sale victoriosa y exalta su poderio con el Songun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Presidente y el Dirigente, exploradores y lideres de la revolucion del Songun, prestaron la atencion primordial a los asuntos militares durante todo el periodo de su guia al pais y concentro la fuerza en consolidar el poderio militar en cada periodo y cada etapa de la revolucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bajo la guia de los grandes Generalisimos, la RPDC defendio honrosamente la libertad y la independencia de la patria, tras aniquilar a los imperialistas norteamericanos que pretendian derrocar en su cuna este pais del pueblo con menos de dos anos de fundacion en aquel entonces, y logro victoria tras victoria en la confrontacion con el imperialismo sin detonaciones y defendio con firmeza la soberania nacional y las conquistas de la revolucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gracias a la destacada idea y la energica orientacion de los grandes Generalisimos, se han preparado las guias programaticas como las Tres Cartas para la Reunificacion de la Patria y las fuertes fuerzas del movimiento por la reunificacion, se ha allanado la era de reunificacion del 15 de Junio y se abrio la radiante perspectiva para la reintegracion territorial del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy dia, la RPDC abre una nueva era dorada de la construccion de un Estado prospero socialista, siguiendo la guia del Mariscal Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enaltecer a Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il como eterno Lider de la revolucion, eterno Presidente de la RPDC y eterno Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional y lograr la historica causa de la construccion de un Estado prospero socialista y la reunificacion de la patria, bajo la  orientacion del Mariscal, constituyen el noble deber del ejercito y pueblo coreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los militares y civiles deben registrar un nuevo auge en la marcha general de hoy por la construccion de la potencia economica y la mejora de las condiciones de vida del pueblo, poniendo de pleno manifiesto el indoblegable fuerza espiritual, y construir mucho mas creaciones de eterna duracion con el poderio de accion conjunta entre el ejercito y el pueblo para que repercuten las vivas del socialismo y las risas felices del pueblo en todo el pais."
