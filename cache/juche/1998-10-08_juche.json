Kumgang\r\n Pyongyang, October 8 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland made public a statement on Wednesday, denouncing  the South Korean rulers' recent attempt to shift the blame for the delay of tour of Mt. Kumgang onto the north.\r\n   According to the statement, the director of the Exchange and Cooperation Department of the South Korean Ministry of National Unification said that tour of Mt. Kumgang has been delayed owing to the \"obscure attitude\" of the north \"calling for additional expense\" and it is \"necessary to confirm the north's willingness\" for promoting tour itself.\r\n   This is a shameless sophistry to distort the reality, mislead public opinion and make a mockery of people, the spokesman noted, and said:\r\n   As recognized at home and abroad, the very one responsible for the delay is none other than the South Korean authorities, who have made vicious and despicable efforts to block nongovernmental exchange and cooperation, while pretending to encourage it.\r\n   They are meddling in the tour of Mt. Kumgang to delay it.\r\n   Not long ago, the Prime Minister and Minister of \"national unification\" contended that \"tourist expense should be restricted to less than dlrs 100 million,\" \"contacts should be held between authorities\" and \"a place should be arranged for meeting of separated families.\"\r\n   Nevertheless, they put up the director to shift the blame for the delay of tour onto the north.\r\n   The entire fellow countrymen in the north, south and abroad will never tolerate the South Korean rulers, the vicious separatists who are making frantic efforts to incite distrust and confrontation among the nation, ignoring the national sentiment and shaking off the warm hand of the fellow countrymen, but make them pay dearly for their heinous crimes.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must not act rashly, mindful that they will be blamed for all the consequences Arising from the delay of tour. \r\n\r\n"

It is clear what this means.\r\n   This is aimed at beautifying the war provoked by the U.S. imperialists in 1950 as a \"sacred war\" for the \"free world\" and justify it in the new century, too. What the U.S. seeks in this is to breathe new life into the South Korean authorities who are begging for a permanent presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea and seize the Korean peninsula forever as a bridgehead for carrying out their strategy for world domination.\r\n   As shown in the 20th century, the Korean War was the first war of aggression ignited by the United States for world domination after world war ii. During the war the U.S. imperialist aggression troops committed thrice-cursed atrocities against the Korean people. \r\n   This was why world public branded the U.S. outrageous acts in Korea as crimes, not a war.\r\n   The United States has not withdrawn its troops from South Korea since its disgraceful defeat in the Korean War.\r\n   The U.S. military presence in South Korea is a root cause of all misfortunes of the Korean people. It not only obstructs the reunification of Korea but also poses constant threats to peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world.\r\n   Nevertheless, the united states is trying to realise the South Korea visits of 60,000 U.S. soldiers hand in glove with the South Korean authorities. This is an unpardonable mockery of and challenge to the Korean people and the world's peace-loving people.\r\n   Disgraceful acts of the south Korean authorities are one more heinous crime against the era and history.\r\n   The Korean people will never tolerate such criminal moves of the United States and the South Korean authorities. \r\n\r\n"

This death was caused by ropes and plastic sheet contained in their paunches.\r\n   According to evidence and veterinary examination, the cattle were handed to the north after they had been forced to eat the ropes and pieces of plastic sheet.\r\n   As you know, Jong Ju Yong donated the cattle to the north out of the compatriotic and humanitarian stand.\r\n   Nevertheless, some of the cattle died. This is a very regrettable thing which enrages the people and makes people feel doubtful about humanitarian assistance from your side.\r\n   The group death of cattle is a serious incident without an equal in humanitarian assistance between the north and the south. Accordingly, we cannot but call your side to account for the death.\r\n   The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyundai Business Group are making a joint investigation into the death of cattle and discussing measures.\r\n   Our side urges your side to pay due attention to this, detect and severely punish the criminal of this grave incident and take relevant measures lest such an incident should recur in humanitarian assistance, because your side was involved from the beginning in the delivery of cattle from honorary chairman Jong Ju Yong to our side as part of humanitarian work.\r\n   I enclose data of veterinary examination of the death of cattle and photographs. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, 71 of 500 heads of the cattle died as of October 6.\r\n   The cause of their death is ropes and pieces of plastic sheet contained in their paunches.\r\n   The volume of ropes contained in their paunches ranges from 400 grams to 36.5 kilograms. The number of the one with 36.5 kilograms is 263/181.\r\n   The volume of the plastic sheet contained in their paunches ranges from 200 square centimetres to 250 square centimetres.\r\n   65 percent of the dead cattle had ropes in their paunches and others both ropes and pieces of plastic sheet.\r\n   Most of the survivors are in bad condition and cases of death are being reported almost every day.\r\n  These ropes are identical to their reins in component and were made of resin, which is not produced in the north.\r\n   All facts prove that the cattle had fallen victims to ill-motivated deeds in the south before they were handed to the north. \r\n\r\n"
