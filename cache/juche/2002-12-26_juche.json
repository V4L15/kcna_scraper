It called on the international community to closely follow the moves taken by the U.S. after groundlessly kicking up a nuclear racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Harising Khang, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in a statement said that what the U.S. truly seeks in raising a hue and cry over North Korea's \"nuclear issue\" is to destroy the economy of the DPRK and stifle its socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Dec. 13 issue of the British newspaper Guardian in an article on the situation on the Korean Peninsula said that such world-stunning announcements made by North Korea as its declaration on resuming the operation of its nuclear facilities and its statement accusing the U.S. of its operation to seize a DPRK ship carrying missile parts that ended in failure convinced the world how difficult it is to deal with the North Korean Government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n North Korea is stunning its rivals stronger than itself in a do-or-die spirit, far from yielding to them, and winning victory by employing strategies and tactics more skillful than theirs. It also said that the U.S. and its allies might have miscalculated, quoting a military expert as saying that the outside world does not understand the psychology of North Korea and it will not bend its knees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many other countries are warning bush, accustomed to superpower behaviour and seized with war fever, to behave with discretion, well aware of North Korea's attitude toward the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even the most conservative diplomats of the U.S. are criticizing Bush's policy, saying that a war with the DPRK is unimaginable and horrible consequences to be entailed in case North Korea burning with revengeful thought takes military actions compels the U.S. to reconsider the war option. Even a limited military attack on a nuclear power plant arouses apprehensions as the DPRK may regard it as a declaration of war, it added.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
