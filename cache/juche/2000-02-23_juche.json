Short as the report was, it involves an issue which cannot be overlooked. Why is Japan giving spurs  to developing and launching space rocket despite its repeated failure? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan claims it is aimed at study of space science. But this is a sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   \"H-2\" and \"M5\" rockets now possessed by Japan can be easily upgraded into intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, if a slight improvement is made in its mechanism.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is so keen on developing space rocket to realize its invariable ambition to become a military giant, a nuclear power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese warhawks have taken much pain to revive militarism for more than 50 years after the war, saying Japan was defeated in the Pacific War because of \"weak strength\", not by the \"judgement of history\". And they have spent a fabulous amount of funds for the development of nuclear weapons and made all preparations to become a military power any moment. What remains to be done by Japan is to develop and possess missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. To this end, Japan is hell-bent on the development of space weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why Japan is now getting so feverish in the moves to develop the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system in collusion with the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is to have space weapons without difficulty with the backing of the United States that only Japan is so keen on developing the \"TMD\" system at a time when China, Russia and EU nations are strongly opposed to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan, together with the United States, is getting overheated in the development of space weapons and preparations for a second Korean war. This reality clearly proves that it was a very just act pertaining to the sovereignty of the DPRK for it to have increased national defence capabilities and made full preparations to repel possible aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will sharply watch Japan's reckless moves to become a military giant and take all necessary counter-measures. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Serious shortage of electricity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- Never before in the history of Korea has there been such power shortage as today. This is adversely affecting the overall economic life in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present power shortage has caused a serious hindrance not only to production and construction but to the normal operation of major related processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A regular railway transport, heating and lighting as well as agriculture are seriously affected by the shortage.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean people hold the United States wholly responsible for all these difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea abounds in power resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state created huge hydropower generating capacity in many parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The existing power generating capacity is enough to satisfactorily meet the requirements for electricity needed for the economic development and people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But in the latter half of the 20th century the DPRK could not guarantee security in harnessing hydropower resources because of the abnormal climatic conditions that swept the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under this situation the state pushed ahead with the construction of an atomic power plant to be operated by a graphite-moderated reactor based on locally available abundant fuel to meet the increasing needs  for electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the atomic power plant project had been pushed ahead as planned, it would have already been completed and paid off profusely and the country would not have been faced with the power shortage as today.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, the U.S. came out with an unreasonable pretext to obstruct the construction of the peaceful nuclear-power base in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. offered to build two light water reactors (LWR) for the DPRK, provided it halts the atomic power plant projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Lifting economic sanctions against the DPRK was one of its promises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But due to the U.S. failure to faithfully implement the related provisions of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework the LWR construction will probably not be finished even by 2010, though the initial plan called for completion by 2003. Its economic sanctions have not been totally lifted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK's freezing of nuclear-power base construction has brought an enormous loss to it for which the U.S. can hardly compensate with its heavy oil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its loss in the field of direct production has already amounted to tens of billions of dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are, of course, other reasons for the acute shortage of electricity in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Power plants and their related fields have been hard hit by years of serious natural disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., refusing to drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK, is taking the lead in escalating pressure and sanctions against it in all aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This has lashed the Korean people into a bitter anger at the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though their conditions remain hard, the Korean people will surely break through them by themselves and build a powerful nation in the near future. \r\n\r\n"
