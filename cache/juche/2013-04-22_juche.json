Korea for Escalating Tension on Korean Peninsula\r\n Pyongyang April 22 (KCNA) -- An emergency meeting of the Religious Believers Council of Korea took place here Monday as the U.S. and the south Korean authorities are pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the worst phase, being engaged in sanctions and pressure on the DPRK despite their lip-service for \"dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t  Present at the meeting were chairman, vice-chairmen, permanent members and members of the council and representatives of organizations of religious fraternities at all levels in Pyongyang and local areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting set \"On dynamically waging nationwide protest movement for immediately ending the U.S. and the south Korean authorities' moves for confrontation with the DPRK\" as its theme.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jang Jae On, chairman of the Council who is also chairman of the Central Committee of the Catholic Association of Korea, made a keynote address. Pastor O Kyong U, secretary general of the Central Committee of the Christian Federation of Korea, Ryo Jong Son, secretary general of the Central Guidance Committee of the Chondoist Association of Korea and the chief priest of Songbul Temple, who are all members of the Central Committee of the council, made speeches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The speakers said that the U.S. and the south Korean authorities have escalated confrontation with the DPRK and hostility toward it after adopting a \"resolution on sanctions\" by abusing the UN Security Council over the peaceful satellite launch by a sovereign state. They branded this as a planned provocation to escalate the tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proposal for dialogue and negotiations made by those who are directly responsible for the escalating tension has greatly infuriated all the religious believers of the DPRK, the speakers said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only Koreans and the world progressives but American religious leaders and other people with differing political views and religious belief have appreciated the undying feats performed by President Kim Il Sung and general secretary Kim Jong Il, they said, adding: The public at home and abroad are increasing voices praising the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un as the father of the nation, a lodestar of national reunification and great men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At this time the confrontation maniacs of south Korea are behaving foolish to cover the sun in the sky. These men without the soul of the nation should be certainly forced to pay a dear price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation can never evade the catastrophic disaster nor can they lead a peaceful religious life as long as the group of Satan is left intact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are trying to turn the Kaesong Industrial Zone into a hotbed of a war, they said, dismissing \"dialogue for normalization of operation\" as absurd.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and the south Korean authorities have true intent of dialogue and negotiations, they should immediately stop all provocative moves and make full apology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An appeal to the believers in south Korea and abroad was adopted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal said that now is the time for religionists loving peace and justice to opt for practical actions, not just making words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It called on religionists in south Korea and abroad to clearly see through the nature of thrice-cursed crimes of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean military gangsters keen on inflicting a nuclear holocaust on the nation and turn out in a just action."

Korea's Dialogue Offer as Insincere\r\n Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and puppet south Korea are making nonsense as to the principled conditions for talks set by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The White House spokesman told reporters on April 18 that the U.S. is still of the stand to hold \"trustworthy and sincere\" negotiations with north Korea, saying that its attitude is insincere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet south Korean regime also made impudent remarks that \"the south wants the north will discontinue assertion that sanctions should be repealed, and go down the road of wise option.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only recently that they cried out for \"punishment\", being keen on \"preemptive nuclear attack\" exercises, blustering that dialogue and negotiations will never help the north dismantle its nuclear program. It is really disgusting that they are now painting themselves as proponents of dialogue. This is a revelation of their invariable confrontation policy to cover up their attempt to ignite a war and stifle the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Dismantlement of nukes first\" and implementation of the \"resolutions on sanctions\" set forth by the hostile forces as preconditions for dialogue are aimed to force the DPRK to lay down arms and bring it into submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. considers the Korean Peninsula a strategic bridgehead for attaining its ambition for world domination. To put the Asia-Pacific region under its control, it needs to conquer Korea and, to this end, it has to render the DPRK militarily ineffective by employing every possible means and method. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by this calculation, the U.S. has constantly been engaged in the dangerous nuclear blackmail and sanctions against the DPRK for decades and whenever their political and military circumstances did not get their way, they made dialogue offer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the U.S. used the six-party talks as leverage for realizing its ambition for stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dialogue rhetoric and war moves on the part of the U.S. are both aimed at stifling the DPRK. Therefore, they are an open challenge to the DPRK and a declaration of showdown with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is clear and fixed in its stand and will. It will respond to the U.S. and other hostile forces' vicious moves for confrontation with it with the consolidation of nuclear force for self-defence and the toughest confrontation with the U.S. No appeasement and deception will ever work on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces should clearly understand that their intensified confrontation moves will touch off bitterer counterattack from the army and people of the DPRK."

            "content": "U.S. Call for Dialogue Is Trick to Deceive Int'l Community: News Analyst\r\n Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- High-ranking U.S. officials have recently called for dialogue and negotiations, urging the DPRK to show its \"will for denuclearization\" as a precondition for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is tantamount to challenge to the line of the Workers' Party of Korea on simultaneously carrying on the economic construction and the building of nuclear forces, which is legalized as one of the DPRK's laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has no face to call for denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In actuality, the DPRK proposed the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula against the U.S. nuclear threat to it and had paid big efforts to that effect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In April 1959, the DPRK Government warned the U.S. of turning south Korea into a nuclear arsenal and offered a proposal for making Asia a nuclear-free zone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the hope of seeing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it joined the Non-proliferation Treaty in 1985. In the 1990s, it signed with south Korea a joint declaration on the denuclearization of the peninsula in a bid to defend the nation's security from the U.S. nuclear threat and made every possible effort for its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. has persistently threatened the DPRK with nukes, constantly creating a danger of nuclear war to the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Soon after the DPRK conducted a nuclear test as self-defensive countermeasure, the U.S. launched Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills against the DPRK with mobilization of what it calls the three strategic nuclear strike means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t B-52 and B-2A bombers flew to the sky above south Korea to stage an exercise for dropping nuclear bombs while nuclear-powered submarines sailed to the waters off south Korea to attend the drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation goes to prove that the U.S. call for the denuclearization of the peninsula is no more than a trick to deceive the international community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The facts have forced the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear deterrent, a guarantee for the nation's security. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. can never expect any dialogue for denuclearization with the DPRK unless it abandons its nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Genuine dialogue is possible only at the phase where the DPRK has acquired nuclear deterrent enough to defuse the U.S. threat of nuclear war, unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail against the former."

            "content": "ACNC revela artimana de EE.UU. y Sur de Corea\r\n Pyongyang, 22 de abril (ACNC) -- En estos dias, Estados Unidos y los titeres surcoreanos censuran las demandas de principios de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t El dia 18, el vocero de la Casa Blanca, en una rueda de prensa, dijo que EE.UU. esta dispuesto a negociar de \"manera fidedigna y sincera\" con el Norte de Corea, pero no es sincera la actitud de este.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tambien los titeres surcoreanos parlotearon con absurdidad que \"el Norte (de Corea) tomara una opcion sabia abandonando su demanda de revocar primero las sanciones\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta hace unos dias ellos se entregaban al \"castigo\" y al entrenamiento de \"ataque preventivo nuclear\" contra la RPDC diciendo que es imposible lograr la renuncia de armas nucleares del Norte con el dialogo y negociaciones, pero de repente se disfrazan de \"partidarios a dialogo\" para encubrir su intencion de provocar la guerra y aplastar a toda costa detras de esa cortina a la RPDC, lo que es la continuacion de su invariable politica conflictiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Renunciar las armas nucleares primero\" y el respeto a \"resoluciones de sancion\", presentados como premisa para el dialogo, persiguen desarmarla y doblegarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. considera la Peninsula Coreana como trampolin estrategico para la realizacion de su ambicion de hegemonia mundial. La estrategia  de este imperio es ocupar Corea para controlar la region de Asia-Pacifico y para ese fin hay que desarmar a la RPDC movilizando todos los medios y metodos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Partiendo de esa estrategia, el imperio yanqui vino valiendose durante varios decenios de los peligrosos chantajes nucleares y las sanciones contra la RPDC y solian hablar del dialogo cada vez que se tornaba desfavorable la situacion politica-militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todo el mundo conoce bien que EE.UU. vino aprovechando tambien las conversaciones a 6 bandas como palanca para realizar su ambicion de aplastar a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ya que el dialogo y las maniobras militares se dirigen a aplastar la RPDC, estos son un desafio abierto a esta y una expresion de la naturaleza conflictiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es clara la respuesta de la RPDC al respecto. Es inconmovible la voluntad de la RPDC de enfrentarse a las maniobras conflictivas anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y otras fuerzas enemigas con las contramedidas superduras tales como el fortalecimiento de las fuerzas armadas nucleares, y nadie podra detenerlo con cualquier aplacamiento y engano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las fuerzas hostiles deben tener presente que sus siniestras maniobras conflictivas chocaran con la rotunda contraofensiva del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea."

            "content": "Acto hostil anti-RPDC de EE. UU.   terminara con derrota amarga, asevera Rodong Sinmun\r\n Pyongyang, 22 de abril (ACNC) -- Las fuerzas belicistas de Estados Unidos deben sacar una leccion merecida en su derrota sufrida en la decada de los 50 del siglo pasado tras invadir con el juicio erroneo a la joven Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Asi inicia el diario Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual difundido este lunes, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La situacion de la Peninsula Coreana corre hacia la fase pesima una vez que los yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos suscribieron el \"plan de operaciones conjuntas para hacer frente a la provocacion local\", lo cual permite tener a este imperio el aparato legal e institucional para introducir automaticamente sus tropas agresoras en el caso de que se produzcan los choques armados locales entre ambas partes coreanas. He aqui la peligrosidad y gravedad del citado plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En actualidad, segun ese plan EE.UU. entra en el estado de guerra movilizando los pertrechos de guerra nuclear de sus tropas agresoras en su territorio principal y el Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La actual administracion de Obama persigue ejecutar forzosamente su politica hostil anti-RPDC en vez de sacar la leccion en esa politica  fracasada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El imperio yanqui hace esfuerzos desesperados al presentir que su politica hostil anti-RPDC no podra evitar el fracaso total en el caso de que la RPDC, digno pais poseedor de armas nucleares, logre hasta la prosperidad economica mediante la construccion de un estado prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es el legitimo derecho de autodefensa de la RPDC tomar las medidas correspondientes dado que el plan de guerra nuclear del imperio entro en la infrenable etapa practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No deseamos la guerra, pero nos enfrentaremos categoricamente a los agresores si estos nos imponen la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No tememos nada en este mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si EE.UU. desencadena la guerra al juzgar mal a su contraparte, seran arrasados limpiamente los nidos de los agresores."
