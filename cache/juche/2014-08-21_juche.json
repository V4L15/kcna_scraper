Korea's Blatant Challenge to Freedom and Peace\r\n Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces finally kicked off the Ulji Freedom Guardian against the DPRK despite its repeated warnings and serious concern of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t UFG is dangerous war drills aimed to mount a surprise preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that involved in these joint military drills are almost all headquarters of the U.S. army units to be hurled into the Korean front in the event of contingency, commanding mechanisms above the regiment level of the three services of the puppet armed forces, puppet central and local administrative bodies, munitions and non-governmental bodies and various types of weaponry including nuclear strike means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces present in south Korea and overseas and the south Korean puppet forces, nearly 100 000 in all, are also involved in this saber-rattling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that the U.S. is applying to these drills for the first time in its history the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" which calls for mounting a preemptive strike by mobilizing all type military means including nuclear weapons if a sign of \"use of nuclear weapons and missiles\" by someone is detected. This is another undisguised nuclear threat and blackmail and brings to light their aggressive nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet group formally announced the   \"tailored deterrence strategy\", a scenario for preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK, in October last year. Later they massively introduced nuclear war equipment to south Korea, staging various forms of military exercises and creating such tense situation on the Korean peninsula that a war may break out any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The application of the nuclear war strategy which calls for using all forms of armed forces including nuclear weapons under this situation would result in increasing the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. application of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" to UFG which it claims is aimed at \"freedom and peace\" is an outright challenge and insult to the desire and wishes of the Korean people and the world people for genuine freedom and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is trumpeting that its nuclear war strategy is aimed to \"cope with the nuclear and missile threats\" from someone. Meanwhile, the U.S. is letting loose sophism that it will put these war drills on an \"annual and regular basis.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, this is nothing but a poor excuse to cover up the aggressive nature of its nuclear war strategy and deceive the public opinion at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. application of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" to war maneuvers under the simulated conditions of a real war is a vivid manifestation of its undisguised scenario to bring down the social system in the DPRK and a blatant challenge to freedom and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is a symbol of sovereignty and dignity of the Korean people and a signpost of freedom and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's sovereignty and freedom and independence on this land are firmly guaranteed by deterrence for self-defense including nukes and missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. scenario to mount a preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK is no more than a foolish daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. which suffered a defeat historically and it was the army and the people of the DPRK that foiled every move of the U.S. which foolishly counted on its corpulent muscle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. regretted that it fought a wrong war with a wrong rival and in the wrong place and in the wrong time. It should bear in mind that what happened in the period of the Korean war will repeat itself in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. seeks to do harm to the DPRK and its deterrence for self-defense through the \"tailored deterrence strategy\", the army and the people of the DPRK will never miss the chance but achieve the complete freedom and independence of the Korean nation on the Korean peninsula."

They have only a foolish dream of evading the responsibility for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"innovative proposal\" is nothing but an artifice to mislead the public opinion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean people of different social standings are demanding merciless punishment of the criminals who turned the south Korean army into pronoun of murderers and rabble. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities should lend ears to the people's mind-set and bring those responsible for such brutalities including Kim Kwan Jin to a court. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a real solution to the problem."

Y se movilizan cerca de 100 mil efectivos surcoreanos y uniformados norteamericanos estacionados en el Sur de Corea y en ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, EE.UU. aplica por primera vez en el presente simulacro la \"estrategia del disuasivo de forma de ajuste\" cuya meta es asestar el ataque preventivo usando las armas nucleares y los demas medios militares en el caso de que se capten los \"indicios de uso de armas nucleares y misiles\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto siendo otra amenaza y chantaje nucleares a la RPDC demuestra claramente el caracter agresivo del simulacro. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos publicaron oficialmente en octubre del ano pasado la estrategia mencionada, guion de ataque preventivo nuclear contra la RPDC. Despues, introdujeron en el suelo surcoreano enormes pertrechos de guerra nuclear y llevaron al borde de la guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana librando los simulacros militares de todos tipos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa aplicacion de la estrategia de guerra nuclear que permite usar los armamentos de todas formas incluso las armas nucleares aumentara mas el peligro de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, la aplicacion de la \"estrategia del disuasivo de forma de ajuste\" en el simulacro conjunto Ulji Freedom Guardian, descrito por EE.UU. como entrenamiento para la \"libertad y paz\", deviene grave violacion e insulto al pueblo coreano y los demas del mundo aspirantes a la verdadera libertad y la paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora EE.UU. habla ruidosamente que su estrategia de guerra nuclear es para \"hacer frente a la amenaza nuclear y de misiles\" de alguien y que en adelante desarrollara anual y regularmente sus ejercicios belicos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, esto es una excusa pueril para encubrir la naturaleza agresiva de la estrategia de guerra nuclear y enganar la opinion publica interna y externa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa aplicacion de la \"estrategia del disuasivo de forma de ajuste\" en la guerra real es la expresion concentrada de la ambicion norteamericana de derrocar el regimen de la RPDC y resulta el desafio frontal a la libertad y la paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC es el simbolo de la soberania y dignidad del pueblo coreano y de la libertad y la paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa soberania, la libertad y la independencia de la RPDC se garantizan firmemente por el disuasivo de autodefensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl intento norteamericano de ataque preventivo nuclear anti-RPDC es una ilusion vana nunca realizable aunque pasen mil anos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHistoricamente, EE.UU. sufre la derrota por nuestros golpes rotundos, y el ejercito y pueblo coreanos frustran paso a paso sus maniobras  insolentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no debe considerar como el pasado el amargo arrepentimiento de sus generales que habian confesado que la guerra coreana fue hecha en el lugar y tiempo mal escogidos y con el rival mal elegido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. intenta danar a la RPDC aunque sea minimo con la \"estrategia del disuasivo de forma de ajuste\" y otros, los militares y civiles coreanos no perderan la oportunidad  y lograran la libertad y la independencia completas en la Peninsula Coreana."
