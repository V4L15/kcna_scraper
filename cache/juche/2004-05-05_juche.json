This is an extremely grave provocation to the north as it is a vicious anti-north plot of the ultra-right conservative forces marginalized by the strong trend of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The North Headquarters of Pomminryon cannot but consider the metal and physical pain the south Korean authorities have imposed on Min, unreasonably linking him to the north, as a serious challenge to it and this compels it to comprehensively reexamine its relations of cooperation with the south organizations in order to prevent south Koreans from falling victim to the SL any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities do not release Min despite the unanimous opposition of the fellow countrymen but sentence him to a penalty, refusing to face up to the present trend of the times, they will be held wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was because the U.S. connived at and defended this and actively cooperated with Israel in its nuclear program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The testimonies of Banunu irrefutably prove that Israel is a belligerent state and a terrorist sponsor threatening peace and security in Middle East and other part of the world by systematically developing nuclear weapons and possessing them and the U.S. has all along overlooked and encouraged its nuclear armament and state terrorism for the mere reason that it is its ally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. connivance, patronage and cooperation with regard to Israel's nuclear armament glaringly reveal its unfair and unjustifiable double-faced nature and double standards in the issue of nuclear non-proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The height of absurdity of the double standards applied by the U.S. finds its vivid manifestation in its act of taking issue with fictitious enriched uranium of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If alliance with the U.S. is the yardstick in deciding the stand toward the nuclear weapons, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty would be a good-for-nothing dead letter and there would be neither need for nor any meaning in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel's possession of nuclear weapons is mainly attributable to the U.S. tacit connivance and cooperation. On the contrary, the DPRK's possession of nuclear deterrent is mainly attributable to the nuclear threat posed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. double standards whereby it connives at, defends and encourages Israel's nuclear armament while trying to force the DPRK to disarm itself, taking issue with its just measure for building up nuclear deterrent for self-defence, indicate that its double-sidedness and shamelessness have been carried into extremes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue, it should demand Israel dismantle nuclear weapons and, at the same time, drop its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK. This would be a fair measure and would be beneficial to a solution to the nuclear issue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
