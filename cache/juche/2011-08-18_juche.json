            "content": "CRPP denuncia ejercicios belicos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\"\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 18 de agosto (ACNC) -- El portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) hizo publica el dia 17 una declaracion de condena a los ejercicios belicos conjuntos Estados Unidos-Sur de Corea \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" que se desarrollan a partir del dia 16. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl texto completo va como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a nuestra fuerte advertencia y a la unanime denuncia de la opinion publica interna y externa, los imperialistas norteamericanos y los belicistas titeres surcoreanos iniciaron por fin los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese simulacro, que se librara en toda la extension surcoreana durante 11 dias desde el 16 hasta el 26, participaran 530 mil efectivos incluso mas de 30 mil efectivos norteamericanos estacionados en el Sur de Corea y en ultramar y las comandancias y unidades de todos los tipos de ejercito titere del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y el Sur de Corea introducen en el simulacro hasta el personal militar de varios paises que habia participado en la pasada guerra coreana, revelando asi abiertamente la intencion de provocar la segunda guerra coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl CRPP denuncia severamente con vehemente indignacion el simulacro \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\", calificandolo de un grave desafio a toda la nacion coreana y la opinion publica interna y externa que aspiran a la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y de una provocacion nunca tolerable a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que no se puede pasar por alto es que en el marco del presente simulacro los belicistas yanquis y surcoreanos realizaran los ejercicios de guerra especial contra la Direccion de la Revolucion de la RPDC y otros de ataque preventivo a las bases de armas nucleares y de misiles de esta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos, insatisfechos con sus actos provocativos que denigran la dignidad suprema de la RPDC, tratan de aplicarlos junto con EE.UU. hasta en los ejercicios belicos de gran envergadura, lo cual provoca la indignacion y la hostilidad de nuestros militares y civiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significa la declaracion de guerra total contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el inicio del presente simulacro EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea desenmascararon el velo de la paz y dialogo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos respondieron con los ejercicios de guerra  agresiva a los esfuerzos constantes de la RPDC por la paz, lo que muestra que ellos no tienen ningun interes en el dialogo y la mejora de las relaciones sino persiguen solamente la confrontacion y la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos son precisamente bribones y maniacos de guerra que por una parte preconizan la \"era de paz y cooperacion\" y por la otra, arman los alborotos belicos.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl desplegar junto con su amo los ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC, el gobernante surcoreano convoca la reunion de seguridad, intensifica mas el estado de alerta del ejercito y practica los ejercicios de refugio de los civiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el presente simulacro, se ha revelado mas claramente la naturaleza conflictiva y belicista de la banda de los titeres surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora todo el mundo observa con sus propios ojos quien es el provocador en la Peninsula Coreana y quien es el perturbador de la paz y del dialogo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuien ama el peligro, en el perece. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los belicistas norteamericanos y surcoreanos desatan a toda costa la guerra de agresion, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC aniquilaran completamente a los invasores y lograran el anhelo de la reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y la banda titere surcoreana no deben burlarnos nunca mas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente simulacro comprueba que es justa nuestra opcion y nos hace redoblar la decision de seguir manteniendola. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo nunca toleraran los ejercicios belicos de caracter provocativo de los belicistas yanquis y surcoreanos, sino los aniquilaran sin piedad."
