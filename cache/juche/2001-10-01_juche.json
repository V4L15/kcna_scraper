            "content": "U.S. urged not to put brake on inter-Korean dialogue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 1 (KCNA) -- As already reported, the inter-Korean minister-level talks that were temporarily stalemated owing to the obstructions of outsiders resumed to reach major agreements.\r\n The recent talks prove that when the process of inter-Korean dialogue and reconciliation and cooperation is promoted smoothly it will lead to the reunification of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is another indication that the reunification of Korea can surely be achieved through inter-Korean dialogue and reconciliation and cooperation and it is a task of the nation that should be carried out without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A stumbling block lying in the way of realizing the cherished desire of the nation is the attitude of the U.S. responsible for the issue of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that inter-Korean relations have developed smoothly in all aspects in the wake of the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration last year. That means that the Korean people have laid the foundation for the independent settlement of the issue of national reunification, a result of the painstaking efforts exerted for more than half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rapid process of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and south of Korea is facing a serious challenge in the wake of the emergence of the present U.S. government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, pursuant to the anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK, comprehensively reexamined what was agreed upon between the DPRK and the preceding U.S. administration to improve the bilateral relations, while putting pressure upon the South Korean authorities to \"adjust the tempo of inter-Korean dialogue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has covertly encouraged the ultra right-wing anti-reunification elements of South Korea to put a brake on the inter-Korean peace process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that the U.S. blocked the progress of inter-Korean relations.   Whenever the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and the desire of the Korean people for reunification mounted, the U.S. worked hard to dampen them under unreasonable pretexts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic lesson shows that for the smooth inter-Korean dialogue it is necessary, first of all, to terminate the interference of outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop throwing a wet blanket over the favourably developing inter-Korean dialogue, going against the desire and will of the Korean people for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the inter-Korean dialogue that has progressed since it was resumed with so much effort is brought to a stalemate owing to the U.S. intervention and obstructions, its consequences will be more serious than ever before.    \r\n\r\n"
