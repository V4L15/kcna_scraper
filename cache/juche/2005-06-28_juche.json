This is, in essence, prompted by a dangerous intention to force the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear weapons and, furthermore, bring down its system come what may under various pretexts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. branded the DPRK as part of \"an axis of evil\" and \"an outpost of tyranny\" and singled it out as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack, a clear indication that the ultimate goal of the U.S. policy toward the DPRK is to overturn its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the height of absurdity for the U.S. to claim that the bilateral relations cannot be normalized unless not only the nuclear issue but \"human rights, terrorism and missile\" and other issues are settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The normalization of the relations between the DPRK and the U.S. can never come true so long as the latter remains hostile to the DPRK and keen to overthrow the former's system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is interested in normalizing the bilateral relations, it should recognize and respect the system in the DPRK and give up its intention to bring it down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though U.S. is talking a lot that it has no hostile intent towards the DPRK and it will not invade it, its actual deeds strongly smack of the intention to bring down the system in the DPRK. \r\n Precisely this compels the DPRK to entertain distrust in the U.S. and to be always on its guard against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should respect the DPRK and give up its design to bring down its system. This is the solution to the problem.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Independent Reunification, Nation's Urgent Task \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- It is the supreme historical task of the Korean nation at which its destiny is staked to achieve   independent reunification, declares Rodong Sinmun in its article Monday.\r\n The author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Outside forces are the very one responsible for the division of Korea and they are the main force standing in the way of its reunification. Hence the reunification of the country can be achieved only by an independent struggle under all circumstances. Dependence on outside forces will only render a still greater depth to national division and confrontation, not to speak of reunification, and will put a tighter noose of subordination around the nation's neck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three charters of national reunification define the principle of independence as the fundamental principle and stand for reunification and thus lay down the principle and ways for the achievement of independent reunification. And the June 15 joint declaration also is a program of independent reunification indicating the way of settling the issue of reunification independently on the basis of the idea of \"By our nation itself\" with it as the core. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of the country is immediately independence for the Korean nation and the struggle for national reunification is a struggle to achieve sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independent reunification is a historical task of the Korean nation that brooks no further delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a tragedy in the nation's history spanning 50 centuries that the Korean nation, a homogeneous nation, remains artificially divided by outside forces. National reunification is utterly infeasible apart from the independent struggle of our nation, its driving force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The longer the national division, the greater the infringement upon the sovereignty and interests of the nation. This is beneficial only to outside forces. There is no more urgent task than reunification for the Korean nation. Independent reunification is the call of the nation and demand of history and era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should answer the call of the country and nation not with words but with a practical action. This is the stand of a patriot for the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fellow countrymen in the north, the south and oversea should bring a new turn in the nation-wide struggle for  independent reunification, holding as high as ever the banner of \"By our nation itself\" and thereby add shine to the June 15 era of reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
