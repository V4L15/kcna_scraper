This makes one recall what the then Foreign Minister Aso said after the DPRK's satellite launch in 2006. He said that Japan could not but be grateful to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government's countermeasure to the DPRK's recent anticipated nuclear test was already clarified on January 31.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plan envisaged Japan's own additional sanctions which called for including several officials such as a vice-chairman of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan in the list of those whose reentry into Japan is banned and putting it into force on the date of a nuclear test, collecting radioactive materials by the Japan Air \"Self-Defence Force's\" T-4 training plane and the U.S. air forces' WC-135 reconnaissance plane as well as getting the UN Security Council toughen \"sanctions\" on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One's true self is bound to come out. So sinister is Japan's intention to meet its interests by finding fault with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan seeks to win favor of its American master and step up militarization by taking the advantage of the alliance with the U.S. which has become all the more tightened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the emergence of ultra-right element Abe, there is an open sign to modify the pacifist constitution and Japan is increasingly lurching to the right. Japan can become militarized any moment for overseas expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has missiles capable of mounting nuclear warheads. The Japanese reactionaries have already deployed their own missile defence system and are set to test it with the DPRK's satellite launch as an occasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years Japan launched several satellites with an aim at space militarization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On January 27 this year a spy satellite lifted off to the space by rocket H-2A from Tanegashima Space Center, Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mission of the satellite is to make precision monitoring of the DPRK and its surrounding areas and use the information for preempting a strike at any object any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though it has stepped up space militarization, Japan took issue with the DPRK and called for UN Security Council's \"resolution on sanctions\". Now it is moving even to impose \"its own sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese politicians have not yet discarded the delusional outlook on the world which was shaped by politicians of a defeated country in the last century. They are politically half-witted guys ignorant of the concept of the mode of existence of a normal state and society in the modern times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such riff-raffs seem to think that they can divert elsewhere the attention of the international community critical of Japan's criminal acts, and attain their sordid purposes. This is the shallow calculation of Japan, a political dwarf.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan had better faithfully fulfill its moral and legal obligations for redressing the criminal past and drop the reckless militarist ambition that threatens peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world."
