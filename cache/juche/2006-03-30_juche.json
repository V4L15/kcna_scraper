The bill calls on the government to compulsorily apply \"economic sanctions against north Korea\" in case of no progress in the settlement of the \"abduction issue\". \r\n  Meanwhile, the Japanese government called a meeting of leading officials of six ministries and agencies such as the Financial Service Agency, the National Police Agency and the Ministry of Economy and Industry on March 15 which discussed the issue of strictly controlling \"remittance and export to north Korea.\"\r\n Minju Joson today observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are keen to suffocate the DPRK economically in a bid to achieve their objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their behavior clearly suggests their ulterior intention to use an economic lever to do harm to the DPRK. Nothing is more base and disgusting than this folly prompted by a way of thinking of a political dwarf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seems to consider economic sanctions as principal leverage for pursuing its policy toward the DPRK though it does not care much. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan must be aware that over the last several decades the DPRK has pushed forward the construction of independent national economy as the basic line of socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are so foolish as to calculate that their application of economic sanctions against the DPRK would bring about a dramatic change there. This, however, only betrays their serious weak point as they are utterly ignorant of the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to make a proper option, cogitating about whether their confrontation with the DPRK in all areas would do Japan good.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The mausoleum is biggest among the tombs of the successive kings of Koryo and was built with much labor. It represents the form of mausoleums in the closing years of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mausoleum consists of twin stone tombs, one for the king in the west and the other for the queen in the east. It is surrounded by various kinds of stone sculptures. It, therefore, is called \"stone sculpture museum\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rectangular compound of the mausoleum is treble-terraced and elongated from east to west. It is approached up a slope by broad stairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The upper terrace is 40 meters from east to west and 24 meters from north to south. In the center of the terrace, there are the twin tombs, each standing on the dodecagon stone foundation. The grave mound is about 6.5 meters high and 13.7 meters in diameter. Each grave mound is surrounded at the bottom with wall-like stones on which 12 spirits of terrain including mouse, cow, tiger and rabbit are engraved in relief. \r\n There are four statues of civil officials on the middle terrace and four statutes of military officers on the third terrace with two at the end of each side.\r\n The statues, about 3.3 meters high, evoke most convincingly the characters that they represent. Their open air setting makes them particularly effective. In bold relief against the mountains looming in the background, they look quite majestic. They are excellent ones among existing old stone sculptures in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After looking round the statues, a foreign historian said: it is wonderful that in the Middle Ages, Europeans used marble as the basic material of stone sculpture but Koryo people created such delicate statues with granite solider than marble as the basic material.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They should, at the same time, fully grant them their status as Koreans in Japan and satisfactorily guarantee Chongryon its legitimate activities in the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.\r\n We strongly urge the Japanese authorities to take an appropriate measure to prevent the repetition of a similar case.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
