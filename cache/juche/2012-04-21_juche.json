The south Korean military cried out for \"punishment\" and \"precision strike\", while bragging the capacity of the missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was the hysteric fit of those who were shocked by the military power of the DPRK displayed through the military parade for celebrating the centenary of the birth of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee Myung Bak, military ignorant and political idiot, toured the research institute and made admonition. Greater irony is that he tried to use the 40 seconds video of missile launch in consoling his clan and relieving it of uneasiness and fear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, south Koreans from all walk of life give sneering laugh at the puppet regime which made public the missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK take no account of the puppet army, mercenary soldiers of the U.S. colony. If the south Korean warmongers make even a rustling sound, the armed forces of the DPRK will eradicate the rats and take hold of the land of the southern part of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak is sadly mistaken if he calculates he can survive in an air-raid shelter of Chongwadae no more than a rat-hole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRats detrimental to human being must be exterminated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee, more dead than alive, had better find his own grave, not clinging to reckless act."

Paektu, benefactor of the Koreans and the sun of the nation who cleared them of their grief as members of a stateless nation, calling back with pride on the 100 year noble history of Juche era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans' warm loyalty and reverence for the great persons are incalculable with money and immeasurable with any yardstick. However, the Lee group had temerity to try to measure them with money only to prove that it is made up of savages who turned their backs on the genuine human world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its recent hideous provocation is no more than hysteric fit of those on the deathbed as they were horror-stricken by the tremendous might of the army and the people of the DPRK who are dynamically advancing toward a final victory keeping pace with the giant footsteps of the supreme leader, firmly holding the arms of the revolution in hands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how hard the rat-like vicious Lee Myung Bak group without equal in the world tries to do harm to the unbreakable single-minded unity in the DPRK, the DPRK remains unfazed. This will only touch off bitterer hatred and resentment among its service personnel and people at their sworn enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee is human scum and half-wit as he is so steeped in sycophancy and submission to the marrow of his bones that he has neither an iota of national identity nor elementary sense of obligation. It is, therefore, a tragedy and shame for the nation to see Lee still alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The world will clearly see what merciless and severe punishment all the service personnel and the people of the DPRK will mete out to the rat-like Lee group going reckless, challenging the Heaven, and what miserable end it will face."
