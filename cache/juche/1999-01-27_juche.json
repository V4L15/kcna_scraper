            "content": "Open letter on truth behind kidnapping of secretary of DPRK mission in \r\nGermany \r\n \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) on January 26 made public an open letter laying bare the truth behind the January 13 kidnapping of a secretary of the DPRK mission in Germany by the South Korean \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The full text of the open letter reads:\r\n   On January 13, Kim Kyong Phil, secretary of the DPRK mission in Germany, and his wife were abducted by the \"ANSP\" in broad daylight.\r\n   The South Korean authorities are resorting to dastardly tricks to divert elsewhere the attention of public opinion at home and abroad, spreading rumours that they \"have nothing to do\" with the kidnapping and the couple \"defected\" to the United States.\r\n   The CPRF, on the basis of the material evidence secured on the spot, opens to the world the truth behind the thrice-cursed terrorist act committed by the \"ANSP,\" the principal kidnapper.\r\n   The kidnapping is an unpardonable anti-national, unethical white terrorism perpetrated in a premeditated and systematic way for the purposes of doing harm to the DPRK and destroying an overseas Koreans' organisation.\r\n   From the end of last year, the \"ANSP\" began to cook up a shocking incident called \"defection of north's diplomat\" in an attempt to impair the ever rising international prestige of the DPRK and dampen the feelings of overseas Koreans for national reunification. Their ill-intentioned operation entered a full-scale stage from the moment when they obtained information that Kim Kyong Phil would return home on January 18 as his term expired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The ANSP worked out a detailed operational plan to threaten, allure and kidnap him with his files stolen by its agent Choe Chang Dong from his computer, and dispatched an action group composed of four persons including Han Hyong Su (man aged about 47) to Berlin. And it ordered its agents disguised as officials of  the consulate in Berlin to command the operation at first hand.\r\n   Having shadowed, watched and wiretapped telephone calls of officials of the DPRK mission in Germany, the action group  hurriedly entered the practical stage as the date of Kim Kyong Phil's return home was at hand.\r\n   On January 9, Han Hyong Su conducted a so-called \"telephone psychological operation\"  with the aim to give a psychological impetus to and allure Kim Kyong Phil, second secretary of the DPRK mission.\r\n   He called Kim and said, \"I have come with a letter of introduction from Mr. Choe Chang Dong who had returned to Seoul from Berlin. I want your help in business matters. \r\nChoe told me that he has some 100 files you have sent to Pyongyang through computer and that he will not abuse them.\" \r\nAnd he asked Kim Kyong Phil to meet at the Hilton Hotel near the DPRK mission at around 10:00 on January 13.\r\n   Taking an ill-boding cue from the unexpected telephone conversation with Han Hyong Su, Kim Kyong Phil scolded him, asking why he made such a rude telephone call.\r\n  Failing to obtain any promise from Kim Kyong Phil, Han Hyong Su tenaciously made several telephone calls of the same content in a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the morning of January 13, he called Kim again and entreated him to help in his trade dealings with the north and meet him.\r\n   Since Han Hyong Su pleaded for a help in his business activities although his introducer Choe Chang Dong was an undesirable agent of the \"ANSP,\" Kim Kyong Phil consulted with the mission and, proceeding from compatriot feelings, promised to meet him at 10:00 on the morning  of January 13 so as to know details of what he wanted.\r\n   Upon receiving a promise from Kim, the Han Hyong Su group decided to abduct him in front of the Hilton Hotel and entered a practical stage. Han Hyong Su, together with a \"Korean student\", appeared in front of the Hilton Hotel, the promised venue, under the  command and observation by two agents of the \"ANSP\" in a car with the plate number \"B-SS-5787.\"\r\n   However, as Kim Kyong Phil came out to the venue together with officials of the DPRK mission, Han Hyong Su could not put the kidnapping plan into practice. Badly confused by this, Han told Kim that he had come from Seoul with the introduction of Choe Chang Dong and asked him to give a helping hand to his business activities. Handing him an envelope with letters \"working plan,\" Han asked Kim to study it scrupulously. At that time, an official of the DPRK mission accompanying Kim asked Han who he was and where he lived, saying that they were needed for contacts related to trade dealings. Fearful that his true nature might be disclosed if he stayed there any longer, Han hurriedly ran away after saying,  \"please study the 'working plan' scrupulously.\" The meeting lasted only five minutes.\r\n   After returning to the mission, Kim Kyong Phil and his party opened the envelope. Contained in it were a slip of a telephone number \"0172-3123375. Han Hyong Su,\" a letter of blackmail, a list of computer files already stolen and 1,000 U.S. dollars.\r\n   Enraged at it, Kim Kyong Phil  immediately informed the ,homeland of the \"ANSP's\" dirty moves, along with his determination to strongly react to the agents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.\r\n   His wife said= \"how dare they distort the fact? I cannot remain a passive onlooker to those who stole my computer files and made fake files.  I will personally meet them and refute what they say.\"\r\n   Having failed in the first kidnapping operation,  Han Hyong Su's group made several phone calls to Kim Kyong Phil from  around 10:30 that day. But, Kim Kyong Phil resolutely dismissed their blackmail,  warning them that he would open their wretched plot to the international community.\r\n   Dismayed at it, they changed the method in a bid to seduce and abduct him at whatever costs.\r\n   At around 12:30, Han Hyong Su phoned him again,  saying \"I am sorry,\" \"I  beg your pardon,\" \"Let us forget this unhappy thing.\" Then, he implored him to reconsider the matter of opening the story to the public,  return the money because it was not his own and pity him who had come to an alien land. \r\n   After answering he would return the dirty money at once, Kim  came out of the DPRK mission office, accompanied by his wife.\r\n  At around 13:00 at local time, the Han Hyong Su group abruptly kidnapped Kim Kyong Phil and his wife when they were returning the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"ANSP's\" kidnapping of a DPRK diplomat in Germany, a self-styled law-governed state, was rude and brazen  terrorism.\r\n   As regards the emergency incident, the DPRK on January 16 sent to the South Korean authorities through a liaison channel at Panmunjom a warning letter containing its principled stand that they should reinstate the secretary and make an apology for the incident.\r\n   The measure was taken out of an intention to smoothly resolve the incident caused by the \"ANSP,\" not worsening the north-south relations on any account.\r\n   But, the South Korean authorities tried to flee from the responsibility by sending a very disgraceful and dastardly reply letter to the north, the letter alleging they were not connected to the incident.\r\n   In actuality, they left  a lot of evidence. A blackmail letter written by Han Hyong Su, a list of stolen computer files, photos of terrorists, plate number of a car, recorded conversations -- these material evidences eloquently show that the \"ANSP\" is the wirepuller of this kidnapping incident. DPRK officials have found that the telephone number of Han Hyong Su was a bogus one not listed in the telephone directory of Germany. So, it was evident that it was a mobile telephone number used by the \"ANSP's\" agents. \r\n   It is ridiculous for the South Korean authorities to try to avoid the blame for the kidnapping case in face of these stark facts and evidences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  South Korea's paid media including the Chosun Ilbo Newspaper had spread the rumour about the couple's \"defection to the United States\" before the mass media of Germany, where the incident took place, did. This is one more evidence that the \"ANSP\" is the chief culprit of the kidnapping case.\r\n   The Chosun Ilbo Newspaper, which speaks for the \"ANSP,\" informed the Yonhap News in Germany of the false news about the couple's \"defection to the United States\" on January 17. The next day, all paid media of South Korea reported that secretary Kim Kyong Phil asked the U.S. consulate for asylum. The point at issue is how the Chosun Ilbo Newspaper collected the news before the news agencies in Germany.\r\n   According to data available, not only the investigation organ of Germany but the German Foreign Ministry and the U.S. embassy said at that time that they knew no fact or evidence that the couple defected to the United States. \r\nThis being the fact, how could the far-off Chosun Ilbo Newspaper know this case? Does this mean that a correspondent of the newspaper met with a phantom \"secretary Kim Kyong Phil\" in the U.S. consulate?\r\n   It is evident that upset by our strong warning, the \"ANSP\" granted the newspaper a script of \"defection to the U.S.\" it had hurriedly written with a view to avoiding the blame for its kidnapping case. The script is the most clumsy and poorest it has ever written.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These days the South Korean authorities talk about \"defection to a third country\" while they first talked about \"defection to the United States.\" this is also a very poor drama to escape from the predicament.\r\n   On January 19, the South Korean authorities announced that the U.S. government had officially notified them that Kim Kyong Phil of North Korea asked for asylum in the United States. They added that the formalities for asylum had been completed on the \"understanding\" of the German government. \r\nThe next day, they told the Yonhap News Kim Kyong Phil might go to a third country, not the United States.\r\nAt first, the South Korean authorities stated they were officially informed  by the United States of the \"defection\", but deny it now. Perhaps their memory served them wrong or their hasty statement invited criticism from the United States. Their incoherent statements evidently prove that the \"defection\" of Kim Kyong Phil and his wife is a plot.\r\n    News media consider that the \"ANSP\" abducted and detained the couple three days to take them to South Korea and, flustered by the DPRK's stern warning, hurriedly transferred them to the U.S. \r\n No matter how loudly they may advertise the kidnapping as \"defection,\" the South Korean authorities can never cover up their colors as kidnapper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The  kidnapping is a result of the premeditated,  systematic plots of the \"ANSP\" against Korean-Germans' organizations and the DPRK mission in Berlin.\r\n   Since the early 1990s the desire for the peaceful reunification of Korea by united efforts of the nation has been growing  stronger among compatriots in Germany and other areas of Europe. They set up in Germany the European regional headquarters of the patriotic National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and launched vigorous activities for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country.\r\n   The existence of the headquarters has been a thorn in the flesh for the South Korean authorities rulers who have sought only national division and confrontation. So, the \"ANSP\" infiltrated its hand-raised agent Choe Chang Dong into Germany in the early '90s for the purpose of undermining  patriotic organizations of compatriots or turn them into anticommunist, anti-north organizations.\r\n   Choe, who deceived compatriots with pompous wording and hypocritical devotion and penetrated into the Pomminryon European regional headquarters, made frantic efforts to disintegrate and undermine the organization from within. He fostered distrust and caused a rift among compatriots and covertly and overtly hindered the patriotic movement for reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also systematically offered the South Korean authorities consulate information on activities of the headquarters and individual compatriots. In may 1995 alone he gave several dozen pieces of information to the consulate and, in 1997, committed espionage on the DPRK mission through wiretapping and stealing of computer files. With his dirty colors as an \"ANSP\" agent discovered by Korean residents in Germany, he could not remain in Germany, rejected by the community of compatriots.\r\n   Tasting a bitter experience from this, the \"ANSP\" worked out an \"operation of North Korean diplomat's defection\" this time and kidnapped the secretary by means of terrorism.\r\n   The \"ANSP\" has not only engaged in political surveillance, intelligence and suppression in South Korea but expanded its activities into Russia, the northeast area of China and other regions where many ethnic Koreans are living, for the purposes of fostering distrust and discord among compatriots and openly terrorizing and abducting DPRK citizens. The latest kidnapping, like the kidnapping of Yun I Sang in Berlin, kidnapping of Kim Dae Jung in Tokyo and kidnapping of Kim Hyong Uk in Paris, only afforded abundant evidence of crimes committed by the \"ANSP\" abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   the incident clearly indicated that the \"ANSP\" is the very one that causes confrontation, antagonism and national discord among compatriots even abroad and is also a gang of regime to the nation. It also revealed that it is the main violator of human rights, master of terrorism and kidnapping and a gang which wantonly violates international law and other countries' law.\r\n   Keeping the kidnapped couple in its hands, the United States shows itself as an accomplice in the incident.\r\n   Whatever the South Korean authorities and the United States say now about the incident, it will only betray their despicable colors.\r\n  If the South Korean authorities and the United States do not reinstate the kidnapped couple but use them in their anti-DPRK plot, screw up the situation of the Korean peninsula and aggravate inter-Korean relations, they will be held fully responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the only concrete barrier in the world that is dividing the Korean territory into the north and south.\r\n   By the barrier, several railways and boulevards and more than 220 big and small roads between the north and south have been cut off and 8 counties and some 120 villages bisected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reinforced concrete structure, 5-8 metres in height, 10-19 metres in lower width and 3-7 metres in upper width, was built by the South Korean authorities with billions of dollars and with the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of people for several years.\r\n   This physical barrier is dividing one and the same territory into two, severing the blood vessel of the homogeneous nation with a history of thousands of years and imposing sufferings of division upon the separated parents, brothers and sisters and friends.\r\n   Even publications of South Korea said that \"it is a structure for permanent division which can be invented and built only by the group seeking the two nations and two states to lay foundations for permanent power.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal of the DPRK government for pulling down the barrier that blocks the nation's desire for reunification is being supported on a worldwide scale.\r\n   An international fact-finding group surveyed and confirmed the concrete barrier on the spot in May Juche 84 (1995)  and published a joint statement calling upon the UN Secretary General and the international community to make efforts for its demolition.\r\n   All foreign visitors to Panmunjom area keenly feel the tragedy of division the Korean nation is suffering, seeing the barrier at first hand.\r\n   Voices calling for demolition of the barrier are ringing out from more than 120 countries of the five continents of the world. \r\n\r\n"
