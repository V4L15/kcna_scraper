This gave confidence and courage to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe workers made an oath to rehabilitate the works by their own efforts. Then she said to the following effect: There is nothing impossible if you buckle down to work with a firm determination. This is the truth we have got in the arduous struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her teachings implanted the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance deep in the hearts of the workers and inspired them forcefully to perform remarkable successes."

Este imperio piensa en que si se establece tal sistema en el Nordeste Asiatico podran asestar el ataque inesperado contra todos los paises asiaticos poniendolos en la esfera  de ataque de sus misiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas EE.UU. acelera el establecimiento del citado sistema tanto mas se creara la situacion complicada y se aumentara el peligro de guerra amenazando y destruyendo gravemente la paz. Es obvio que las potencias del Nordeste Asiatico no estaran con los brazos cruzados ante tal maquinacion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque EE.UU. actue astutamente difundiendo la supuesta \"amenaza de misil\" de alguien para encubrir el caracter agresivo y el proposito de su establecimiento del sistema antimisiles, no convencera a nadie ante el claro mundo como hoy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe ver serenamente la realidad y poner fin a sus maquinaciones del inutil y agresivo aumento armamentista y  del  establecimiento del sistema antimisiles, que pueden destruir la estabilidad estrategica del mundo y acarrear la nueva carrera armamentista y la guerra nuclear."
